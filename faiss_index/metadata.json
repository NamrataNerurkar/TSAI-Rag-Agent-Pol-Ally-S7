They spend slightly less than seven hours [per week] with friends. If you expand the definition of friends to include family and neighbors and coworkers outside of work, that whole set of people\u2014including your friends, companions\u2014they spent about 15 hours. And then in 2014, we started slowly kind of ticking down. And by 2021, we have this data, we\u2019re spending less than three hours [per week] with our friends, we\u2019re spending less than 10 hours with our companions, and what are we doing with that time we used to spend with our friends and companions? We\u2019re now spending it alone.

But there are definitely some reasons why making friends gets harder as you age.</span><span class=\"footnote-hovercard-target\"><a data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3-162101380\" href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-to-have-friends-past-age-30#footnote-3-162101380\" target=\"_self\" rel class=\"footnote-anchor\">3</a></span><span> </span></p><p>Most obviously, there are just a lot more demands on your time. A lot of people in their 30s get more serious about their jobs and careers. People also tend to get married and have kids, which takes up a lot of their time. People\u2019s parents start getting old, and they have to do eldercare. There are simply fewer hours in the day for socializing, and you\u2019re more tired during the free hours you do have.</p><p>Also, if you\u2019re an educated type, much of your youth is spent in various institutions that throw you together with a bunch of other people your age and of a similar social class \u2014 high school, summer programs, college, study abroad, grad school, internships, entry-level cohorts at work, and so on.

A big part of making friends is </span><em>relating to other people</em><span>, which requires finding some kind of commonality \u2014 some shared life experience or emotion that lets you understand someone else better by making an analogy with yourself.

Yes, there are plenty of differences between young people, but the structure of our society \u2014 and of life itself \u2014 means that the similarities are almost always there, ready to form the initial basis of a new friendship. </p><p>As you get out into the working world, life paths diverge.

Maybe one person lived overseas and then got a PhD, while another went to work for a big company and stayed in the town where they went to college. People get married and divorced, some have kids and some don\u2019t. Life-changing health problems, both physical and mental, become more common. Beyond these easily quantifiable factors, there are an infinitude of subtly divergent life experiences that accumulate steadily over time. By their 30s, people are much more alien to each other. </p><p>This obstacle isn\u2019t insurmountable, but it helps if you realize it\u2019s there. You need to understand that as you get older, most friendships will be voyages of exploration, where you spend a long time and a lot of effort understanding someone else\u2019s unique life experiences. So be prepared for that, and try to see it as a rewarding exercise \u2014 working to understand someone else broadens your own perspective, and makes you a more well-rounded person too.</p><p>(Actually, this is probably good advice for young people too. Some young people tend to just assume that their shared experiences of school, or pop culture, or sports make them the same as their friends, and thus ignore some of the deeper differences.)</p><p>Anyway, making friends past age 30 usually means you have less time, less energy, less help, and less shared experience.

But there\u2019s also just something magical when </span><em>your friends become friends with each other</em><span>.

While doing shared activities, you all talk and interact, which helps you get to know each other better; you also cooperate, which gives you the conviction that these people are on your side. </span></p><p><span>When you\u2019re young, shared activities are often things like drinking and partying.

In fact, this works pretty well for bonding, and young people do it a lot \u2014 or at least they did when I was young, before phones ate everyone\u2019s lives. On TV shows like </span><em>Friends</em><span> and </span><em>Seinfeld</em><span>, the characters are often just hanging out and chatting. But as people get older and the demands on their time get more severe, they usually have less time to just slack off. And lots of people feel like they always need to be </span><em>doing something</em><span> with their time; if you invite someone over, you\u2019ll probably want to have something more enticing to propose than just \u201ccome and hang out\u201d. As a result, communal slacking is a bit of a lost art. </span></p><p><span>Anyway, in my experience, the best shared activity to base a friend group around is </span><strong>food</strong><span>. There are several reasons for this. </span></p><p>First of all, eating is something that everyone does, so the set of people you can invite into a food-based friend group is maximally broad \u2014 in contrast to some specialized niche activity like sailing or climate activism, where only a few dedicated people will want to join.

I used to have a hot pot club that went out every two weeks, and eventually tried every hot pot restaurant in San Francisco. Those outings became adventures, and occasions to do other stuff together while we were out. </p><p>An alternative idea is to cook together regularly \u2014 you can either pot luck, or alternate cooking for each other. Not only is it fun to cook together, but you also end up teaching each other how to cook a bunch of new dishes. You can do regular formal dinner parties, or keep it informal and casual. There are also variants of this approach, like drinking tea or wine together. </p><p><span>A second activity to organize a friend group around is </span><strong>entertainment</strong><span>. For example, watching things together on screens \u2014 TV, movies, anime, whatever \u2014 is a regular activity that can draw in a wide variety of people.

The downside of this is that you don\u2019t get to be as selective about your friend group.)</p><p>A lot of people like to organize their friend groups around activities that are more ambitious and specialized than eating and watching TV \u2014 things like hiking, or rock-climbing, or pottery, or Dungeons and Dragons, etc. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with this. But I find that these are a little harder than food and entertainment, for a few reasons. First, these are things that not everyone does; the more you orient your friendships around hiking, the more you\u2019re limiting yourself to making friends with people who hike. Second, unless they\u2019re pretty dedicated, these aren\u2019t things people do every day \u2014 therefore, they represent additional demands on the time of busy people. </p><p>Of course, hobbies like hiking are great, and it\u2019s nice to do them with friends.

In </span><em>Friends</em><span> they all go hang out at a particular coffee shop, or at Monica\u2019s apartment. In </span><em>Seinfeld</em><span> they all go hang out at Jerry\u2019s apartment, or at their favorite diner. Basically, a good gathering place is a house or \u201cthird space\u201d whose location is fairly central and convenient for everyone. </span></p><p><span>In TV shows, of course, they limit the number of sets to save money and build audience familiarity.

Just invite them over to cook, or invite them out to hot pot club, or invite them over to watch Star Trek together. If they click with the rest of the group, you have a new friend. </p><p><span>And note that a friend group helps you meet new people without even trying, because </span><em>your friends bring in new people too</em><span>.

Ideally, I believe, you should have some friends who are more than just adult playmates \u2014 people you can confide in, people you can rely on, people who really understand who you are. These are your \u201cchosen family\u201d. They\u2019re some of the most important relationships you\u2019ll have in your life \u2014 in a very real way, they define who you are as a person. There\u2019s no hard-and-fast boundary between close friends and more casual friends; it\u2019s a spectrum. Closeness tends to develop gradually over time, and it feels a little different in each case.</p><p><span>Good advice about how to build close friendships is actually more common than advice about how to build friend groups. You can read a bazillion </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/smarter-living/how-to-have-closer-friendships.html\" rel>New York Times articles</a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1cg64ot/making_close_friends_as_an_adult/\" rel>Reddit threads</a><span> on the topic, and they all tend to mostly say the same things. So I\u2019ll keep it brief. </span></p><p><span>There are basically two things that define a really close friendship: </span><strong>understanding</strong><span>, and </span><strong>interdependence</strong><span>. Your close friend has to understand who you really are, and you also have to know that you can count on them if you need help. If a friendship has only one of those things and not the other, it\u2019s not really a close one. </span></p><p><span>Understanding gets built up over time, but it can\u2019t reach a truly",

We all have certain things that we\u2019re reluctant to tell other people about ourselves \u2014 not necessarily </span><em>secrets</em><span>, but core truths of our lives that we don\u2019t like yelling at everyone we meet at a party. Occasionally these might be facts about your life, but usually they\u2019re just vulnerabilities and desires and fears. </span></p><p>In order to make a really close friend, you have to tell them at least some of those things, and they have to tell you theirs. You have to have moments when you open yourself to another person and make yourself vulnerable to them. And you also have to have moments where they do this for you. You don\u2019t both have to do it at the same time, but it has to happen on both sides. </p><p>Those moments of vulnerability and openness can happen in a group setting, but much more often they happen one-on-one. So you have to hang out with your friends outside of the group sometimes. </p><p>The other thing you need for a close friendship is interdependence \u2014 you need to know you can rely on your friend, and they need to know they can rely on you. There\u2019s no way to prove this in an absolute sense, of course \u2014 you\u2019ll almost certainly never know",

There\u2019s no way to prove this in an absolute sense, of course \u2014 you\u2019ll almost certainly never know if your friend would really lay down their life for you, because that sort of situation almost never actually comes up. </p><p>Instead, what you need is to ask favors of your friends, and do favors for them as well. Maybe you help them put together a bookshelf, and then borrow their car. Maybe they take care of your rabbit, and you help them find a job. Etc. You have to not be afraid to ask for favors from your close friends, and you have to want to do favors for them too. Don\u2019t intentionally test people by seeing if you can get them to do stuff for you, of course. Just wait until you really need something, then ask. Eventually this builds up, like a muscle \u2014 whenever you learn that your friend needs help, you won\u2019t even think twice before you offer to do it. </p><p><span>Anyway, building close friendships can happen serendipitously, and if you have a good friend group and you do one-on-one hangouts too, it probably will. But I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with being deliberate about it, and pushing things along, especially in terms of having those deep, revealing conversations.

And then in 2014, we started slowly kind of ticking down.

I realize that my own experiences aren\\u2019t universal and that my own techniques won\\u2019t work for everyone. Other people have their own approaches \\u2014 just last year, the blogger Cartoons Hate Her <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cartoonshateher.com/p/at-28-i-taught-myself-to-be-likable\\\\\\\">wrote a similar guide</a>, which is longer and more detailed than mine. </p><p>But anyway, here\\u2019s how I do it. </p><h4>Why making friends gets harder after age 30</h4><p>I titled this post \\u201CHow to have friends past age 30\\u201D, because most of the people who ask me for advice about this, or who complain about not being able to make friends, are over 30. I think much of this advice will work for young people too. But there are definitely some reasons why making friends gets harder as you age.<a class=\\\\\\\"footnote-anchor\\\\\\\" data-component-name=\\\\\\\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\\\\\\\" id=\\\\\\\"footnote-anchor-3\\\\\\\" href=\\\\\\\"#footnote-3\\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\\"_self\\\\\\\">3</a> </p><p>Most obviously, there are just a lot",

A lot of people in their 30s get more serious about their jobs and careers. People also tend to get married and have kids, which takes up a lot of their time. People\\u2019s parents start getting old, and they have to do eldercare. There are simply fewer hours in the day for socializing, and you\\u2019re more tired during the free hours you do have.</p><p>Also, if you\\u2019re an educated type, much of your youth is spent in various institutions that throw you together with a bunch of other people your age and of a similar social class \\u2014 high school, summer programs, college, study abroad, grad school, internships, entry-level cohorts at work, and so on. Meeting people isn\\u2019t as hard because there are higher powers doing a lot of the work for you. </p><p>But there\\u2019s another big reason that friendships get tougher as you age, and it\\u2019s that life experiences diverge. A big part of making friends is <em>relating to other people</em>, which requires finding some kind of commonality \\u2014 some shared life experience or emotion that lets you understand someone else better by making an analogy with yourself.

College and other institutions sort us by social class and shepherd us through even more shared life experiences. Yes, there are plenty of differences between young people, but the structure of our society \\u2014 and of life itself \\u2014 means that the similarities are almost always there, ready to form the initial basis of a new friendship. </p><p>As you get out into the working world, life paths diverge.

People get married and divorced, some have kids and some don\\u2019t. Life-changing health problems, both physical and mental, become more common. Beyond these easily quantifiable factors, there are an infinitude of subtly divergent life experiences that accumulate steadily over time.

Well, first of all, it saves time; hanging out with a bunch of friends at once is a kind of economy of scale. There\\u2019s also probably some deep-seated human instinct for having a group of friends \\u2014 a hunting band, or a village, or something like that. But there\\u2019s also just something magical when <em>your friends become friends with each other</em>. A group of N friends has N(N-1)/2 connections between them, and when most of those connections become deep ones, it adds layers of richness to the social dynamic when you all meet up. </p><p>And in fact, there\\u2019s another huge benefit to having a friend group, which is that <em>it\\u2019s a tool that lets you make new friends</em>. </p><p>I intentionally titled this section \\u201CHow to have a friend group and meet lots of people\\u201D, instead of the other way around. You might think that in order to have a friend group, what you need to do is to first meet lots of people on a one-on-one basis, and then assemble them into a gang by introducing them all to each other. You certainly <em>can</em> do things that way, and I\\u2019ve done it once or twice. But a much easier way",

You certainly <em>can</em> do things that way, and I\\u2019ve done it once or twice.

The first is a bigger ask \\u2014 it\\u2019s basically like a friend date (and might sometimes get mistaken for an actual date). The latter is much lower stakes. Your friend group also serves as a source of \\u201C<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof\\\\\\\">social proof</a>\\u201D \\u2014 basically, a new friend can see that people like you, which makes them less afraid of becoming your friend.</p><p>OK, so how do you get a friend group in the first place? I wrote <a href=\\\\\\\"https://x.com/Noahpinion/status/1555399819689992192\\\\\\\">a Twitter thread</a> about this a few years ago, so I\\u2019ll mainly be expanding on that. </p><p>Most importantly, friend groups are organized around <strong>shared activities</strong> \\u2014 stuff that you all do together. While doing shared activities, you all talk and interact, which helps you get to know each other better; you also cooperate, which gives you the conviction that these people are on your side. </p><p>When you\\u2019re young, shared activities are often things like drinking and partying.

On TV shows like <em>Friends</em> and <em>Seinfeld</em>, the characters are often just hanging out and chatting. But as people get older and the demands on their time get more severe, they usually have less time to just slack off. And lots of people feel like they always need to be <em>doing something</em> with their time; if you invite someone over, you\\u2019ll probably want to have something more enticing to propose than just \\u201Ccome and hang out\\u201D. As a result, communal slacking is a bit of a lost art. </p><p>Anyway, in my experience, the best shared activity to base a friend group around is <strong>food</strong>. There are several reasons for this. </p><p>First of all, eating is something that everyone does, so the set of people you can invite into a food-based friend group is maximally broad \\u2014 in contrast to some specialized niche activity like sailing or climate activism, where only a few dedicated people",

And third, when people eat, they feel happy and relaxed, which facilitates pleasant interaction. </p><p>One idea is to have a group of friends who periodically goes out to dinner. I used to have a hot pot club that went out every two weeks, and eventually tried every hot pot restaurant in San Francisco. Those outings became adventures, and occasions to do other stuff together while we were out. </p><p>An alternative idea is to cook together regularly \\u2014 you can either pot luck, or alternate cooking for each other. Not only is it fun to cook together, but you also end up teaching each other how to cook a bunch of new dishes. You can do regular formal dinner parties, or keep it informal and casual. There are also variants of this approach, like drinking tea or wine together. </p><p>A second activity to organize a friend group around is <strong>entertainment</strong>.

The downside of watching TV together is that you end up talking less, but the upside is that you always have something to talk <em>about</em>. </p><p>I like food and TV/movies as a form of shared entertainment because it\\u2019s so broad \\u2014 it\\u2019s a lowest-common-denominator thing that takes zero mental effort. Anyone can do it, and pretty much everyone needs some time each day to let their brain zone out.

But I find that these are a little harder than food and entertainment, for a few reasons. First, these are things that not everyone does; the more you orient your friendships around hiking, the more you\\u2019re limiting yourself to making friends with people who hike.

One technique is to build up a large diverse friend group organized around things like food and entertainment, and then find a few people from that group who want to go hiking with you. In my experience it\\u2019s easier to do it this way instead of making hiking your whole social scene.</p><p>Anyway, another thing that I find really helps with the formation of a friend group is a <strong>gathering place</strong>. In <em>Friends</em> they all go hang out at a particular coffee shop, or at Monica\\u2019s apartment. In <em>Seinfeld</em> they all go hang out at Jerry\\u2019s apartment, or at their favorite diner. Basically, a good gathering place is a house or \\u201Cthird space\\u201D whose location is fairly central and convenient for everyone. </p><p>In TV shows, of course, they limit the number of sets to save money and build audience familiarity. But I find that a regular gathering place (or two) makes it a lot easier to have a stable friend group, for a few reasons. First, it helps with <em>coordination</em> of the shared activities \\u2014 if you always have to find a different place to watch Star Trek, it raises the <a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy\\\\\\\">activation energy</a> required",

Just invite them over to cook, or invite them out to hot pot club, or invite them over to watch Star Trek together. If they click with the rest of the group, you have a new friend. </p><p>And note that a friend group helps you meet new people without even trying, because <em>your friends bring in new people too</em>. You\\u2019re not doing all the work yourself. A friend group is like a snowball that just keeps accumulating more prospective friends once it reaches a certain size.

We all have certain things that we\\u2019re reluctant to tell other people about ourselves \\u2014 not necessarily <em>secrets</em>, but core truths of our lives that we don\\u2019t like yelling at everyone we meet at a party. Occasionally these might be facts about your life, but usually they\\u2019re just vulnerabilities and desires and fears. </p><p>In order to make a really close friend, you have to tell them at least some of those things, and they have to tell you theirs. You have to have moments when you open yourself to another person and make yourself vulnerable to them. And you also have to have moments where they do this for you. You don\\u2019t both have to do it at the same time, but it has to happen on both sides. </p><p>Those moments of vulnerability and openness can happen in a group setting, but much more often they happen one-on-one. So you have to hang out with your friends outside of the group sometimes. </p><p>The other thing you need for a close friendship is interdependence \\u2014 you need to know you can rely on your friend, and they need to know they can rely on you. There\\u2019s no way to prove this in an absolute sense, of course \\u2014 you\\u2019ll almost certainly never know if your friend would really lay down their life for you, because that sort of situation almost never actually comes up. </p><p>Instead, what you need is to ask favors of your friends,",

Maybe you help them put together a bookshelf, and then borrow their car. Maybe they take care of your rabbit, and you help them find a job. Etc. You have to not be afraid to ask for favors from your close friends, and you have to want to do favors for them too. Don\\u2019t intentionally test people by seeing if you can get them to do stuff for you, of course. Just wait until you really need something, then ask. Eventually this builds up, like a muscle \\u2014 whenever you learn that your friend needs help, you won\\u2019t even think twice before you offer to do it. </p><p>Anyway, building close friendships can happen serendipitously, and if you have a good friend group and you do one-on-one hangouts too, it probably will. But I think there\\u2019s nothing wrong with being deliberate about it, and pushing things along, especially in terms of having those deep, revealing conversations. People over 30 have such incommensurate life experiences that you probably need <em>more</em> deep conversations than if you were young.

If you expand the definition of friends to include family and neighbors and coworkers outside of work, that whole set of people\u2014including your friends, companions\u2014they spent about 15 hours. And then in 2014, we started slowly kind of ticking down. And by 2021, we have this data, we\u2019re spending less than three hours [per week] with our friends, we\u2019re spending less than 10 hours with our companions, and what are we doing with that time we used to spend with our friends and companions? We\u2019re now spending it alone.

I think much of this advice will work for young people too. But there are definitely some reasons why making friends gets harder as you age.</span><span class=\"footnote-hovercard-target\"><a data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3-162101380\" href=\"https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-to-have-friends-past-age-30#footnote-3-162101380\" target=\"_self\" rel class=\"footnote-anchor\">3</a></span><span> </span></p><p>Most obviously, there are just a lot more demands on your time. A lot of people in their 30s get more serious about their jobs and careers. People also tend to get married and have kids, which takes up a lot of their time. People\u2019s parents start getting old, and they have to do eldercare. There are simply fewer hours in the day for socializing, and you\u2019re more tired during the free hours you do have.</p><p>Also, if you\u2019re an educated type, much of your youth is spent in various institutions that throw you together with a bunch of other people your age and of a similar social class \u2014 high school, summer programs, college, study abroad, grad school, internships, entry-level cohorts at work, and so on.

A big part of making friends is </span><em>relating to other people</em><span>, which requires finding some kind of commonality \u2014 some shared life experience or emotion that lets you understand someone else better by making an analogy with yourself. It would be very difficult to make friends with an alien spider, or a robot (though there are many great science fiction novels about people who surmount this challenge). </span></p><p>When we\u2019re young, the people growing up around us are fairly similar to us \u2014 they usually go to the same schools, watch the same TV programs, and have broadly done similar things in life. College and other institutions sort us by social class and shepherd us through even more shared life experiences. Yes, there are plenty of differences between young people, but the structure of our society \u2014 and of life itself \u2014 means that the similarities are almost always there, ready to form the initial basis of a new friendship. </p><p>As you get out into the working world, life paths diverge.

Maybe one person lived overseas and then got a PhD, while another went to work for a big company and stayed in the town where they went to college. People get married and divorced, some have kids and some don\u2019t. Life-changing health problems, both physical and mental, become more common. Beyond these easily quantifiable factors, there are an infinitude of subtly divergent life experiences that accumulate steadily over time. By their 30s, people are much more alien to each other. </p><p>This obstacle isn\u2019t insurmountable, but it helps if you realize it\u2019s there. You need to understand that as you get older, most friendships will be voyages of exploration, where you spend a long time and a lot of effort understanding someone else\u2019s unique life experiences. So be prepared for that, and try to see it as a rewarding exercise \u2014 working to understand someone else broadens your own perspective, and makes you a more well-rounded person too.</p><p>(Actually, this is probably good advice for young people too. Some young people tend to just assume that their shared experiences of school, or pop culture, or sports make them the same as their friends, and thus ignore some of the deeper differences.)</p><p>Anyway, making friends past age 30 usually means you have less time, less energy, less help, and less shared experience.

In fact, this works pretty well for bonding, and young people do it a lot \u2014 or at least they did when I was young, before phones ate everyone\u2019s lives. On TV shows like </span><em>Friends</em><span> and </span><em>Seinfeld</em><span>, the characters are often just hanging out and chatting. But as people get older and the demands on their time get more severe, they usually have less time to just slack off. And lots of people feel like they always need to be </span><em>doing something</em><span> with their time; if you invite someone over, you\u2019ll probably want to have something more enticing to propose than just \u201ccome and hang out\u201d. As a result, communal slacking is a bit of a lost art. </span></p><p><span>Anyway, in my experience, the best shared activity to base a friend group around is </span><strong>food</strong><span>. There are several reasons for this. </span></p><p>First of all, eating is something that everyone does, so the set of people you can invite into a food-based friend group is maximally broad \u2014 in contrast to some specialized niche activity like sailing or climate activism, where only a few dedicated people will want to join.

And third, when people eat, they feel happy and relaxed, which facilitates pleasant interaction. </p><p>One idea is to have a group of friends who periodically goes out to dinner. I used to have a hot pot club that went out every two weeks, and eventually tried every hot pot restaurant in San Francisco. Those outings became adventures, and occasions to do other stuff together while we were out. </p><p>An alternative idea is to cook together regularly \u2014 you can either pot luck, or alternate cooking for each other. Not only is it fun to cook together, but you also end up teaching each other how to cook a bunch of new dishes. You can do regular formal dinner parties, or keep it informal and casual. There are also variants of this approach, like drinking tea or wine together. </p><p><span>A second activity to organize a friend group around is </span><strong>entertainment</strong><span>. For example, watching things together on screens \u2014 TV, movies, anime, whatever \u2014 is a regular activity that can draw in a wide variety of people.

The downside of this is that you don\u2019t get to be as selective about your friend group.)</p><p>A lot of people like to organize their friend groups around activities that are more ambitious and specialized than eating and watching TV \u2014 things like hiking, or rock-climbing, or pottery, or Dungeons and Dragons, etc. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with this. But I find that these are a little harder than food and entertainment, for a few reasons. First, these are things that not everyone does; the more you orient your friendships around hiking, the more you\u2019re limiting yourself to making friends with people who hike. Second, unless they\u2019re pretty dedicated, these aren\u2019t things people do every day \u2014 therefore, they represent additional demands on the time of busy people. </p><p>Of course, hobbies like hiking are great, and it\u2019s nice to do them with friends.

In my experience it\u2019s easier to do it this way instead of making hiking your whole social scene.</p><p><span>Anyway, another thing that I find really helps with the formation of a friend group is a </span><strong>gathering place</strong><span>. In </span><em>Friends</em><span> they all go hang out at a particular coffee shop, or at Monica\u2019s apartment. In </span><em>Seinfeld</em><span> they all go hang out at Jerry\u2019s apartment, or at their favorite diner. Basically, a good gathering place is a house or \u201cthird space\u201d whose location is fairly central and convenient for everyone. </span></p><p><span>In TV shows, of course, they limit the number of sets to save money and build audience familiarity. But I find that a regular gathering place (or two) makes it a lot easier to have a stable friend group, for a few reasons. First, it helps with </span><em>coordination</em><span> of the shared activities \u2014 if you always have to find a different place to watch Star Trek, it raises the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy\" rel>activation energy</a><span> required for people to hang out.

Just invite them over to cook, or invite them out to hot pot club, or invite them over to watch Star Trek together. If they click with the rest of the group, you have a new friend. </p><p><span>And note that a friend group helps you meet new people without even trying, because </span><em>your friends bring in new people too</em><span>.

Ideally, I believe, you should have some friends who are more than just adult playmates \u2014 people you can confide in, people you can rely on, people who really understand who you are. These are your \u201cchosen family\u201d. They\u2019re some of the most important relationships you\u2019ll have in your life \u2014 in a very real way, they define who you are as a person. There\u2019s no hard-and-fast boundary between close friends and more casual friends; it\u2019s a spectrum. Closeness tends to develop gradually over time, and it feels a little different in each case.</p><p><span>Good advice about how to build close friendships is actually more common than advice about how to build friend groups. You can read a bazillion </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/smarter-living/how-to-have-closer-friendships.html\" rel>New York Times articles</a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1cg64ot/making_close_friends_as_an_adult/\" rel>Reddit threads</a><span> on the topic, and they all tend to mostly say the same things. So I\u2019ll keep it brief. </span></p><p><span>There are basically two things that define a really close friendship: </span><strong>understanding</strong><span>, and </span><strong>interdependence</strong><span>. Your close friend has to understand who you really are, and you also have to know that you can count on them if you need help.

We all have certain things that we\u2019re reluctant to tell other people about ourselves \u2014 not necessarily </span><em>secrets</em><span>, but core truths of our lives that we don\u2019t like yelling at everyone we meet at a party. Occasionally these might be facts about your life, but usually they\u2019re just vulnerabilities and desires and fears. </span></p><p>In order to make a really close friend, you have to tell them at least some of those things, and they have to tell you theirs. You have to have moments when you open yourself to another person and make yourself vulnerable to them. And you also have to have moments where they do this for you. You don\u2019t both have to do it at the same time, but it has to happen on both sides. </p><p>Those moments of vulnerability and openness can happen in a group setting, but much more often they happen one-on-one. So you have to hang out with your friends outside of the group sometimes. </p><p>The other thing you need for a close friendship is interdependence \u2014 you need to know you can rely on your friend, and they need to know they can rely on you.

Maybe you help them put together a bookshelf, and then borrow their car. Maybe they take care of your rabbit, and you help them find a job. Etc. You have to not be afraid to ask for favors from your close friends, and you have to want to do favors for them too. Don\u2019t intentionally test people by seeing if you can get them to do stuff for you, of course. Just wait until you really need something, then ask.

They spend slightly less than seven hours [per week] with friends. If you expand the definition of friends to include family and neighbors and coworkers outside of work, that whole set of people\\u2014including your friends, companions\\u2014they spent about 15 hours. And then in 2014, we started slowly kind of ticking down. And by 2021, we have this data, we\\u2019re spending less than three hours [per week] with our friends, we\\u2019re spending less than 10 hours with our companions, and what are we doing with that time we used to spend with our friends and companions? We\\u2019re now spending it alone.

I realize that my own experiences aren\\u2019t universal and that my own techniques won\\u2019t work for everyone. Other people have their own approaches \\u2014 just last year, the blogger Cartoons Hate Her <a href=\\\\\\\"https://www.cartoonshateher.com/p/at-28-i-taught-myself-to-be-likable\\\\\\\">wrote a similar guide</a>, which is longer and more detailed than mine. </p><p>But anyway, here\\u2019s how I do it. </p><h4>Why making friends gets harder after age 30</h4><p>I titled this post \\u201CHow to have friends past age 30\\u201D, because most of the people who ask me for advice about this, or who complain about not being able to make friends, are over 30. I think much of this advice will work for young people too.

A lot of people in their 30s get more serious about their jobs and careers. People also tend to get married and have kids, which takes up a lot of their time. People\\u2019s parents start getting old, and they have to do eldercare. There are simply fewer hours in the day for socializing, and you\\u2019re more tired during the free hours you do have.</p><p>Also, if you\\u2019re an educated type, much of your youth is spent in various institutions that throw you together with a bunch of other people your age and of a similar social class \\u2014 high school, summer programs, college, study abroad, grad school, internships, entry-level cohorts at work, and so on. Meeting people isn\\u2019t as hard because there are higher powers doing a lot of the work for you. </p><p>But there\\u2019s another big reason that friendships get tougher as you age, and it\\u2019s that life experiences diverge. A big part of making friends is <em>relating to other people</em>, which requires finding some kind of commonality \\u2014 some shared life experience or emotion that lets you understand someone else better by making an analogy with yourself.

College and other institutions sort us by social class and shepherd us through even more shared life experiences. Yes, there are plenty of differences between young people, but the structure of our society \\u2014 and of life itself \\u2014 means that the similarities are almost always there, ready to form the initial basis of a new friendship. </p><p>As you get out into the working world, life paths diverge.

People get married and divorced, some have kids and some don\\u2019t. Life-changing health problems, both physical and mental, become more common. Beyond these easily quantifiable factors, there are an infinitude of subtly divergent life experiences that accumulate steadily over time.

Well, first of all, it saves time; hanging out with a bunch of friends at once is a kind of economy of scale. There\\u2019s also probably some deep-seated human instinct for having a group of friends \\u2014 a hunting band, or a village, or something like that. But there\\u2019s also just something magical when <em>your friends become friends with each other</em>. A group of N friends has N(N-1)/2 connections between them, and when most of those connections become deep ones, it adds layers of richness to the social dynamic when you all meet up. </p><p>And in fact, there\\u2019s another huge benefit to having a friend group, which is that <em>it\\u2019s a tool that lets you make new friends</em>. </p><p>I intentionally titled this section \\u201CHow to have a friend group and meet lots of people\\u201D, instead of the other way around. You might think that in order to have a friend group, what you need to do is to first meet lots of people on a one-on-one basis, and then assemble them into a gang by introducing them all to each other. You certainly <em>can</em> do things that way, and I\\u2019ve done it once or twice. But a much easier way is",

You certainly <em>can</em> do things that way, and I\\u2019ve done it once or twice. But a much easier way is to make new friends by <em>inviting them to join an existing friend group</em>. </p><p>Basically, instead of \\u201CHey, want to come hang out with me?\\u201D, it\\u2019s easier to ask a new acquaintance \\u201CHey, want to come hang out with me and my friends?\\u201D. The first is a bigger ask \\u2014 it\\u2019s basically like a friend date (and might sometimes get mistaken for an actual date). The latter is much lower stakes. Your friend group also serves as a source of \\u201C<a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof\\\\\\\">social proof</a>\\u201D \\u2014 basically, a new friend can see that people like you, which makes them less afraid of becoming your friend.</p><p>OK, so how do you get a friend group in the first place? I wrote <a href=\\\\\\\"https://x.com/Noahpinion/status/1555399819689992192\\\\\\\">a Twitter thread</a> about this a few years ago, so I\\u2019ll mainly be expanding on that. </p><p>Most importantly, friend groups are organized around <strong>shared activities</strong> \\u2014 stuff that you all do together. While doing shared activities, you all talk and interact, which helps you get to know each other better; you also cooperate, which gives you the conviction that these people are on your side. </p><p>When you\\u2019re young, shared activities are often things like drinking and partying.

In fact, this works pretty well for bonding, and young people do it a lot \\u2014 or at least they did when I was young, before phones ate everyone\\u2019s lives. On TV shows like <em>Friends</em> and <em>Seinfeld</em>, the characters are often just hanging out and chatting. But as people get older and the demands on their time get more severe, they usually have less time to just slack off. And lots of people feel like they always need to be <em>doing something</em> with their time; if you invite someone over, you\\u2019ll probably want to have something more enticing to propose than just \\u201Ccome and hang out\\u201D. As a result, communal slacking is a bit of a lost art. </p><p>Anyway, in my experience, the best shared activity to base a friend group around is <strong>food</strong>. There are several reasons for this. </p><p>First of all, eating is something that everyone does, so the set of people you can invite into a food-based friend group is maximally broad \\u2014 in contrast to some specialized niche activity like sailing or climate activism, where only a few dedicated people will",

Second, eating with friends economizes on time \\u2014 you\\u2019re going to spend time eating anyway, so you might as well kill two birds with one stone. And third, when people eat, they feel happy and relaxed, which facilitates pleasant interaction. </p><p>One idea is to have a group of friends who periodically goes out to dinner. I used to have a hot pot club that went out every two weeks, and eventually tried every hot pot restaurant in San Francisco. Those outings became adventures, and occasions to do other stuff together while we were out. </p><p>An alternative idea is to cook together regularly \\u2014 you can either pot luck, or alternate cooking for each other. Not only is it fun to cook together, but you also end up teaching each other how to cook a bunch of new dishes. You can do regular formal dinner parties, or keep it informal and casual. There are also variants of this approach, like drinking tea or wine together. </p><p>A second activity to organize a friend group around is <strong>entertainment</strong>.

The downside of watching TV together is that you end up talking less, but the upside is that you always have something to talk <em>about</em>. </p><p>I like food and TV/movies as a form of shared entertainment because it\\u2019s so broad \\u2014 it\\u2019s a lowest-common-denominator thing that takes zero mental effort. Anyone can do it, and pretty much everyone needs some time each day to let their brain zone out. Might as well do it with friends!</p><p>(Note: For parents with small children, having your kids play with other people\\u2019s kids, or at least meeting up and letting the kids play while you chat, is the natural shared activity. The downside of this is that you don\\u2019t get to be as selective about your friend group.)</p><p>A lot of people like to organize their friend groups around activities that are more ambitious and specialized than eating and watching TV \\u2014 things like hiking, or rock-climbing, or pottery, or Dungeons and Dragons, etc. There\\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with this. But I find that these are a little harder than food and entertainment, for a few reasons. First, these are things that not everyone does; the more you orient your friendships around hiking, the more you\\u2019re limiting yourself to making friends with people who hike. Second, unless they\\u2019re pretty dedicated, these aren\\u2019t things people do every day \\u2014 therefore, they represent additional demands",

One technique is to build up a large diverse friend group organized around things like food and entertainment, and then find a few people from that group who want to go hiking with you. In my experience it\\u2019s easier to do it this way instead of making hiking your whole social scene.</p><p>Anyway, another thing that I find really helps with the formation of a friend group is a <strong>gathering place</strong>. In <em>Friends</em> they all go hang out at a particular coffee shop, or at Monica\\u2019s apartment. In <em>Seinfeld</em> they all go hang out at Jerry\\u2019s apartment, or at their favorite diner. Basically, a good gathering place is a house or \\u201Cthird space\\u201D whose location is fairly central and convenient for everyone. </p><p>In TV shows, of course, they limit the number of sets to save money and build audience familiarity. But I find that a regular gathering place (or two) makes it a lot easier to have a stable friend group, for a few reasons. First, it helps with <em>coordination</em> of the shared activities \\u2014 if you always have to find a different place to watch Star Trek, it raises the <a href=\\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy\\\\\\\">activation energy</a> required for",

Just invite them over to cook, or invite them out to hot pot club, or invite them over to watch Star Trek together. If they click with the rest of the group, you have a new friend. </p><p>And note that a friend group helps you meet new people without even trying, because <em>your friends bring in new people too</em>. You\\u2019re not doing all the work yourself. A friend group is like a snowball that just keeps accumulating more prospective friends once it reaches a certain size.

We all have certain things that we\\u2019re reluctant to tell other people about ourselves \\u2014 not necessarily <em>secrets</em>, but core truths of our lives that we don\\u2019t like yelling at everyone we meet at a party. Occasionally these might be facts about your life, but usually they\\u2019re just vulnerabilities and desires and fears. </p><p>In order to make a really close friend, you have to tell them at least some of those things, and they have to tell you theirs. You have to have moments when you open yourself to another person and make yourself vulnerable to them. And you also have to have moments where they do this for you. You don\\u2019t both have to do it at the same time, but it has to happen on both sides. </p><p>Those moments of vulnerability and openness can happen in a group setting, but much more often they happen one-on-one. So you have to hang out with your friends outside of the group sometimes. </p><p>The other thing you need for a close friendship is interdependence \\u2014 you need to know you can rely on your friend, and they need to know they can rely on you. There\\u2019s no way to prove this in an absolute sense, of course \\u2014 you\\u2019ll almost certainly never know if your friend would really lay down their life for you, because that sort of situation almost never actually comes up. </p><p>Instead, what you need is to ask favors of your friends, and",

Maybe you help them put together a bookshelf, and then borrow their car. Maybe they take care of your rabbit, and you help them find a job. Etc. You have to not be afraid to ask for favors from your close friends, and you have to want to do favors for them too. Don\\u2019t intentionally test people by seeing if you can get them to do stuff for you, of course. Just wait until you really need something, then ask. Eventually this builds up, like a muscle \\u2014 whenever you learn that your friend needs help, you won\\u2019t even think twice before you offer to do it. </p><p>Anyway, building close friendships can happen serendipitously, and if you have a good friend group and you do one-on-one hangouts too, it probably will. But I think there\\u2019s nothing wrong with being deliberate about it, and pushing things along, especially in terms of having those deep, revealing conversations. People over 30 have such incommensurate life experiences that you probably need <em>more</em> deep conversations than if you were young.

But one thing I am good at is having friends. Not everyone knows this about me, but in fact I\u2019ve always been an extremely social person. I\u2019m pretty good at assembling a cohesive group of friends, who do things together regularly and become friends with each other. And at least since my college days, I\u2019ve also had quite a number of very close friends \u2014 people I can tell anything, people I know will have my back, some who feel as close as family. Apparently this is somewhat unusual for an American man in this day and age \u2014 or at least, more unusual than it ought to be. In 2023, Pew reported that only 38% of Americans have five or more close friends.

An AEI survey in 2021 showed big drops when compared to earlier surveys: And in 2023, the Surgeon General published a report entitled \u201cOur Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation\u201d, exploring various possible factors at work. The loneliness trend seems to predate the pandemic, and to be especially acute among young people. Derek Thompson had an excellent podcast episode back in 2022 when he interviewed the economist Bryce Ward about this so-called \u201cfriendship recession\u201d: Ward\u2019s chronology of the friendship recession sure makes it sound like smartphones and social media are at least one likely culprit: The American Time Use Survey started in 2003, and between 2003 and 2013, people spent basically the same amount of time with their friends. They spend slightly less than seven hours [per week] with friends. If you expand the definition of friends to include family and neighbors and coworkers outside of work, that whole set of people\u2014including your friends, companions\u2014they spent about 15 hours. And then in 2014, we started slowly kind of ticking down. And by 2021, we have this data, we\u2019re spending less than three hours [per week] with our friends, we\u2019re spending less than 10 hours with our companions, and what are we doing with that time we used to spend with our friends and companions? We\u2019re now spending it alone. We\u2019ve increased the amount of time we spend alone by almost 10 hours.

I don\u2019t have policy ideas for combating this trend, except for the obvious one of banning smartphone use in schools. This obviously won\u2019t work past a certain age, and smartphones are not the only cause of loneliness. I would love to tell you that building denser, less car-centric urban environments would help people have more friends, but unfortunately the evidence shows that people in big cities are just as likely \u2014 or even more likely \u2014 to be lonely compared to people who live in the suburbs. So while we search for policy solutions to our national epidemic of friendlessness, I thought I might offer some personal thoughts on how I\u2019ve managed to have such a good quantity and quality of friends over the years. I realize that my own experiences aren\u2019t universal and that my own techniques won\u2019t work for everyone. Other people have their own approaches \u2014 just last year, the blogger Cartoons Hate Her wrote a similar guide, which is longer and more detailed than mine. But anyway, here\u2019s how I do it. Why making friends gets harder after age 30 I titled this post \u201cHow to have friends past age 30\u201d, because most of the people who ask me for advice about this, or who complain about not being able to make friends, are over 30.

I think much of this advice will work for young people too. But there are definitely some reasons why making friends gets harder as you age. Most obviously, there are just a lot more demands on your time. A lot of people in their 30s get more serious about their jobs and careers. People also tend to get married and have kids, which takes up a lot of their time. People\u2019s parents start getting old, and they have to do eldercare. There are simply fewer hours in the day for socializing, and you\u2019re more tired during the free hours you do have. Also, if you\u2019re an educated type, much of your youth is spent in various institutions that throw you together with a bunch of other people your age and of a similar social class \u2014 high school, summer programs, college, study abroad, grad school, internships, entry-level cohorts at work, and so on. Meeting people isn\u2019t as hard because there are higher powers doing a lot of the work for you. But there\u2019s another big reason that friendships get tougher as you age, and it\u2019s that life experiences diverge. A big part of making friends is relating to other people, which requires finding some kind of commonality \u2014 some shared life experience or emotion that lets you understand someone else better by making an analogy with yourself.

When we\u2019re young, the people growing up around us are fairly similar to us \u2014 they usually go to the same schools, watch the same TV programs, and have broadly done similar things in life. College and other institutions sort us by social class and shepherd us through even more shared life experiences. Yes, there are plenty of differences between young people, but the structure of our society \u2014 and of life itself \u2014 means that the similarities are almost always there, ready to form the initial basis of a new friendship. As you get out into the working world, life paths diverge. Maybe one person lived overseas and then got a PhD, while another went to work for a big company and stayed in the town where they went to college. People get married and divorced, some have kids and some don\u2019t. Life-changing health problems, both physical and mental, become more common.

By their 30s, people are much more alien to each other. This obstacle isn\u2019t insurmountable, but it helps if you realize it\u2019s there. You need to understand that as you get older, most friendships will be voyages of exploration, where you spend a long time and a lot of effort understanding someone else\u2019s unique life experiences. So be prepared for that, and try to see it as a rewarding exercise \u2014 working to understand someone else broadens your own perspective, and makes you a more well-rounded person too. (Actually, this is probably good advice for young people too. Some young people tend to just assume that their shared experiences of school, or pop culture, or sports make them the same as their friends, and thus ignore some of the deeper differences.) Anyway, making friends past age 30 usually means you have less time, less energy, less help, and less shared experience. But it\u2019s still very possible. How to have a friend group and meet lots of people Individual friendships are great.

But there\u2019s also just something magical when your friends become friends with each other. A group of N friends has N(N-1)/2 connections between them, and when most of those connections become deep ones, it adds layers of richness to the social dynamic when you all meet up. And in fact, there\u2019s another huge benefit to having a friend group, which is that it\u2019s a tool that lets you make new friends. I intentionally titled this section \u201cHow to have a friend group and meet lots of people\u201d, instead of the other way around. You might think that in order to have a friend group, what you need to do is to first meet lots of people on a one-on-one basis, and then assemble them into a gang by introducing them all to each other. You certainly can do things that way, and I\u2019ve done it once or twice. But a much easier way is to make new friends by inviting them to join an existing friend group. Basically, instead of \u201cHey, want to come hang out with me?\u201d, it\u2019s easier to ask a new acquaintance \u201cHey, want to come hang out with me and my friends?\u201d.

The first is a bigger ask \u2014 it\u2019s basically like a friend date (and might sometimes get mistaken for an actual date). The latter is much lower stakes. Your friend group also serves as a source of \u201csocial proof\u201d \u2014 basically, a new friend can see that people like you, which makes them less afraid of becoming your friend. OK, so how do you get a friend group in the first place? I wrote a Twitter thread about this a few years ago, so I\u2019ll mainly be expanding on that. Most importantly, friend groups are organized around shared activities \u2014 stuff that you all do together. While doing shared activities, you all talk and interact, which helps you get to know each other better; you also cooperate, which gives you the conviction that these people are on your side. When you\u2019re young, shared activities are often things like drinking and partying. As you get older, your tolerance for alcohol (and other drugs) goes way down, and your enthusiasm for dancing all night in a loud, sweaty, crowded club tends to wane a bit. It\u2019s possible for a shared activity to be just hanging out and talking and doing nothing. In fact, this works pretty well for bonding, and young people do it a lot \u2014 or at least they did when I was young,",

On TV shows like Friends and Seinfeld, the characters are often just hanging out and chatting. But as people get older and the demands on their time get more severe, they usually have less time to just slack off. And lots of people feel like they always need to be doing something with their time; if you invite someone over, you\u2019ll probably want to have something more enticing to propose than just \u201ccome and hang out\u201d. As a result, communal slacking is a bit of a lost art. Anyway, in my experience, the best shared activity to base a friend group around is food. There are several reasons for this. First of all, eating is something that everyone does, so the set of people you can invite into a food-based friend group is maximally broad \u2014 in contrast to some specialized niche activity like sailing or climate activism, where only a few dedicated people will want to join. Second, eating with friends economizes on time \u2014 you\u2019re going to spend time eating anyway, so you might as well kill two birds with one stone. And third, when people eat, they feel happy and relaxed, which facilitates pleasant interaction. One idea is to have a group of friends who periodically goes out",

One idea is to have a group of friends who periodically goes out to dinner. I used to have a hot pot club that went out every two weeks, and eventually tried every hot pot restaurant in San Francisco. Those outings became adventures, and occasions to do other stuff together while we were out. An alternative idea is to cook together regularly \u2014 you can either pot luck, or alternate cooking for each other. Not only is it fun to cook together, but you also end up teaching each other how to cook a bunch of new dishes. You can do regular formal dinner parties, or keep it informal and casual. There are also variants of this approach, like drinking tea or wine together. A second activity to organize a friend group around is entertainment. For example, watching things together on screens \u2014 TV, movies, anime, whatever \u2014 is a regular activity that can draw in a wide variety of people. The downside of watching TV together is that you end up talking less, but the upside is that you always have something to talk about. I like food and TV/movies as a form of shared entertainment because it\u2019s so broad \u2014 it\u2019s a lowest-common-denominator thing that takes zero mental effort.

(Note: For parents with small children, having your kids play with other people\u2019s kids, or at least meeting up and letting the kids play while you chat, is the natural shared activity. The downside of this is that you don\u2019t get to be as selective about your friend group.) A lot of people like to organize their friend groups around activities that are more ambitious and specialized than eating and watching TV \u2014 things like hiking, or rock-climbing, or pottery, or Dungeons and Dragons, etc. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with this. But I find that these are a little harder than food and entertainment, for a few reasons. First, these are things that not everyone does; the more you orient your friendships around hiking, the more you\u2019re limiting yourself to making friends with people who hike. Second, unless they\u2019re pretty dedicated, these aren\u2019t things people do every day \u2014 therefore, they represent additional demands on the time of busy people.

In my experience it\u2019s easier to do it this way instead of making hiking your whole social scene. Anyway, another thing that I find really helps with the formation of a friend group is a gathering place. In Friends they all go hang out at a particular coffee shop, or at Monica\u2019s apartment. In Seinfeld they all go hang out at Jerry\u2019s apartment, or at their favorite diner. Basically, a good gathering place is a house or \u201cthird space\u201d whose location is fairly central and convenient for everyone. In TV shows, of course, they limit the number of sets to save money and build audience familiarity. But I find that a regular gathering place (or two) makes it a lot easier to have a stable friend group, for a few reasons. First, it helps with coordination of the shared activities \u2014 if you always have to find a different place to watch Star Trek, it raises the activation energy required for people to hang out. Better to just go to the one house where everyone watches Star Trek. Second, a gathering place helps with serendipity \u2014 if people in the group get used to going there, they\u2019ll encounter each other more often.

(As a side note, I believe that small homes and crowded third spaces are a big part of why Japanese people have an even harder time hanging out with friends than Americans do.) Once you have a shared activity and a gathering place, it becomes very easy to use the group as a vehicle for making new friends. Just invite them over to cook, or invite them out to hot pot club, or invite them over to watch Star Trek together. If they click with the rest of the group, you have a new friend. And note that a friend group helps you meet new people without even trying, because your friends bring in new people too. You\u2019re not doing all the work yourself. A friend group is like a snowball that just keeps accumulating more prospective friends once it reaches a certain size. This helps balance out the attrition from people moving away. And you don\u2019t have to just keep doing the same things in the same places. Once you have regular hangouts with your friend group, you can organize more ambitious activities. For example, one fun thing a lot of people do when they\u2019re young, but which I only really discovered in recent years, is group travel. It can take a",

Of course, this all leaves the question of how to meet prospective friends in the first place. If you just moved to a new city and you don\u2019t know anyone, you\u2019re facing a cold start problem \u2014 you\u2019ll need to make a couple of initial friends in order to get your friend group going. In fact, this is the hardest part of making friends. There\u2019s no reliable one-size-fits-all solution to the cold start problem, because it depends on your circumstances, and because a lot of it ends up being luck. It requires you to be at least a little bit outgoing \u2014 to just walk up to people and ask them to hang out \u2014 without the benefit of an existing gang to back you up. Often it can take a couple months or more before you meet those first one or two people who really click with you \u2014 especially if you\u2019re not a naturally outgoing person.

This has worked surprisingly well for a number of people I know. I rarely say anything positive about those social networks, but I must admit they\u2019re the best for making friends. How to build close friendships A group of friends who all hang out together is wonderful, but it doesn\u2019t automatically lead to really close personal friendships. Ideally, I believe, you should have some friends who are more than just adult playmates \u2014 people you can confide in, people you can rely on, people who really understand who you are.

Good advice about how to build close friendships is actually more common than advice about how to build friend groups. You can read a bazillion New York Times articles and Reddit threads on the topic, and they all tend to mostly say the same things. So I\u2019ll keep it brief. There are basically two things that define a really close friendship: understanding, and interdependence. Your close friend has to understand who you really are, and you also have to know that you can count on them if you need help. If a friendship has only one of those things and not the other, it\u2019s not really a close one. Understanding gets built up over time, but it can\u2019t reach a truly deep level without confessions. We all have certain things that we\u2019re reluctant to tell other people about ourselves \u2014 not necessarily secrets, but core truths of our lives that we don\u2019t like yelling at everyone we meet at a party. Occasionally these might be facts about your life, but usually they\u2019re just vulnerabilities and desires and fears. In order to make a really close friend, you have to tell them at least some of those things, and they have to tell you theirs. You have to have moments when you open yourself to another",

You don\u2019t both have to do it at the same time, but it has to happen on both sides. Those moments of vulnerability and openness can happen in a group setting, but much more often they happen one-on-one. So you have to hang out with your friends outside of the group sometimes. The other thing you need for a close friendship is interdependence \u2014 you need to know you can rely on your friend, and they need to know they can rely on you. There\u2019s no way to prove this in an absolute sense, of course \u2014 you\u2019ll almost certainly never know if your friend would really lay down their life for you, because that sort of situation almost never actually comes up. Instead, what you need is to ask favors of your friends, and do favors for them as well. Maybe you help them put together a bookshelf, and then borrow their car. Maybe they take care of your rabbit, and you help them find a job. Etc. You have to not be afraid to ask for favors from your close friends, and you have to want to do favors for them too.

Eventually this builds up, like a muscle \u2014 whenever you learn that your friend needs help, you won\u2019t even think twice before you offer to do it. Anyway, building close friendships can happen serendipitously, and if you have a good friend group and you do one-on-one hangouts too, it probably will. But I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with being deliberate about it, and pushing things along, especially in terms of having those deep, revealing conversations. People over 30 have such incommensurate life experiences that you probably need more deep conversations than if you were young. And yet as people age, they often become more closed-off and less willing to spill their deepest, darkest secrets to someone from their hot pot club. So I think you have to work at it. Having friends is one of the most important components of a complete, fulfilled human life. It\u2019s just too important to leave entirely to chance.

Oren Cass, the chief economist at American Compass and a prominent advocate of industrial policy from the right, has chosen the second path. He is continuing to fiercely defend the idea that tariffs are a way to reindustrialize the American economy. In a post on April 4th, shortly after Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, Cass defended the tariffs and made some minor suggestions for how Trump might tweak the policy: As the economic carnage from the tariffs became more apparent, Cass continued to double down. In a debate with Jason Furman and others a week later, Cass argued that trade had devastated American manufacturing in the 2000s. A few days after that, he argued that many Americans will enjoy working in factories: [I]f fully 25% of poll respondents say they\u2019d prefer a factory job to their current job, that suggests massive potential unmet by the current labor market\u2026One in four?! That would be 40 million of 160 million employed Americans!\u2026When we talk about reindustrializing America, we are talking about adding millions of manufacturing jobs, not tens of millions\u2014several percentage points of the labor force, not a quarter or more\u2026[P]lease, let\u2019s stop with the \u201cnobody wants to work in a factory,\u201d and even more so the \u201cI don\u2019t see you working in factory.\u201d And a few days after that, Cass argued that Trump\u2019s tariff strategy is primed to succeed, because meeting American domestic demand is more important than exporting: Our $1 trillion trade deficit presents an enormous opportunity.

Most economic analysis of the American position in the global economy seems to assume that export markets represent the key opportunity for U.S. industry and thus success depends upon winning in those markets. From that perspective, for instance, tariffs on the intermediate goods that manufacturers might use in their own production is a disaster. How can a U.S. producer hope to compete with a German producer if the U.S. producer has to pay a tariff on components from China and the German producer does not? This assumption makes good sense in the typical developing-country situation where the domestic market is small and trade imbalances are likely a minor factor\u2026But the top priority and major opportunity for the United States is not higher exports, it is recovering the capacity to meet domestic demand with domestic supply\u2026Indeed, the U.S. will be building leading-edge semiconductor fabs to meet domestic demand for a long time before it needs to consider export markets at all.

In this case, the long-term \u201cgain\u201d is economic self-sufficiency and a bonanza of factory jobs. Formally speaking, you can\u2019t prove that this is wrong, except by waiting a bunch of years and then observing that reindustrialization didn\u2019t happen. There are no hard and fast economic laws of the Universe; we have a lot of theories, but economies are complex beasts, and the past is an imperfect guide to the future. I can\u2019t completely rule out the possibility that Trump\u2019s tariffs will cause a vast crop of steel factories and shoe factories and semiconductor factories to spring up from the American topsoil like mushrooms after the rain. And yet when we look at what\u2019s actually happening to American manufacturing in real time, it doesn\u2019t look anything at all like the beginning of the reindustrialization that Cass imagines. Here\u2019s a quick roundup of news from just the last few days: Volvo is cutting 800 jobs at three U.S. factories, citing tariff uncertainty.

The April NY Manufacturing Survey is recording some of the most negative conditions that it has ever recorded, with new orders and shipments falling off a cliff: The Philadelphia Fed\u2019s survey of manufacturers is also showing a massive dropoff in new orders. Falling orders are causing Volvo to lay off hundreds of American workers at two factories. Plenty of evidence shows that American manufacturers are pulling back on their capital spending plans because of tariffs: Manufacturing pessimism has spiked dramatically in April as industrial producers deal with changing tariff plans and try to assess how global trade policy will impact their costs and operations in the coming months\u2026Several surveys released this week show huge swings in business confidence between January, when most manufacturers had a positive outlook for near-term conditions\u2026and April, when sentiment changed for the much, much worse\u2026Some of the most dramatic declines came from the Equipment Leasing Finance Foundation (ELFF), an organization that represents lenders that help manufacturers obtain new capital equipment for factories. In March, more than half of manufacturers surveyed by that group expected capital spending to increase or stay about the same in the next four months.

Cleveland Cliffs, the steel company, is laying off 1200 workers. It\u2019s not hard to understand why American manufacturing is getting hit hard by tariffs. As I\u2019ve said in many posts, and as knowledgeable folks are screaming from the rooftops, broad tariffs of the type Trump has imposed raise the price of imported components and makes U.S. manufacturers less competitive. Even manufacturers who initially scoffed at this effect are quickly learning what a big problem it is: And on top of the effect of the tariffs themselves, uncertainty about future tariffs \u2014 which has spiked to record levels under Trump \u2014 hurts manufacturing even more, because manufacturers don\u2019t know how to plan their future supply chains. This is not a difficult principle to understand. And yet somehow, Oren Cass appears not to grasp it. In his post that I quoted above, Cass argues that the \u201cimported components\u201d problem only applies to exports, not to manufacturing for the domestic market. That is obviously wrong. For an American auto factory in Kentucky, the cost of components matters just as much whether you\u2019re selling your cars to customers in Dubai or Dallas.

Without the ability to source cheap car parts from Mexico and Canada, American manufacturers will see their costs for domestic manufacturing rise. This is why you can\u2019t just measure the U.S. trade deficit and assume that this amount will be added to U.S. manufacturing if we wall off our economy (as Cass assumes in his post). The amount of domestic demand for manufactured products is not fixed. More expensive components will mean more expensive manufactured products, which will cause Americans to consume less. Americans will become poorer, and they\u2019ll also substitute their consumption away from goods and toward services (whose price will go up by less). Cass\u2019 hand-waving dismissal of exports also ignores another crucial factor: scale effects. Export markets help American manufacturers scale up their production, which lowers their costs \u2014 and thus helps them sell even more to American consumers, capturing more of the U.S. market as well. Commentators like Sam Hammond, who argue that the U.S. should focus on export promotion instead of import substitution, are correct for this reason. (On top of all that, it\u2019s not clear how much tariffs even reduce trade deficits. As Arnaud Costinot and Ivan Werning show in a new theory paper, it\u2019s possible that even very high tariffs might leave trade deficits mostly unchanged, while simply making an economy poorer.)

Cass and other tariff defenders can simply continue to assume that tariffs will reduce trade deficits by a lot, and that this reduction will translate into a whole bunch of new U.S. factories. Perhaps they assume that the unfolding carnage in the U.S. manufacturing industry is simply a temporary disruption, and that after a short period of suffering, American manufacturers will get back on their feet, invest in domestic production capacity, and eventually do better than ever. Except if that were true, we\u2019d probably see two things. First, we\u2019d see manufacturing stocks doing well, because far-sighted investors would know if American manufacturers would eventually benefit from tariffs. Instead, the stocks of American manufacturers have been crashing. Also, if tariffs provided a protective shield under which American manufacturers could flourish, we\u2019d probably see a bunch of them rushing to invest and build new capacity. But we don\u2019t; capex in the industry is plummeting. In other words, neither investors nor manufacturers themselves believes in the long-term reindustrialized future that Oren simply assumes will come about. Instead, it appears that tariffs are dramatically accelerating America\u2019s deindustrialization. And if that\u2019s true, Cass\u2019 other arguments all go up in smoke.

I feel like I deserve a break. What better way to distract myself from my country slowly morphing into a real-life dystopia than to watch TV shows about fantasy dystopias? I\u2019ve been a fan of Black Mirror since the show first came out 14 years ago. I love sci-fi, as you all know, and this show is (usually) some of the smartest \u2014 a worthy successor to The Twilight Zone, and in some ways even better. But I don\u2019t just watch the show for the high concepts; it\u2019s also full of incredibly well-told stories. Some of these are terrifying and gripping, some are poignant and sad, some are downright silly, but almost all of them are great. I credit the singular genius of the show\u2019s creator and writer, Charlie Brooker. (He also has a habit of spinning story plots from the lyrics of rock songs, which is very cool.) So today I thought that just for fun, I\u2019d go through and review and rate a whole bunch of Black Mirror episodes. I initially wanted to do all of the episodes, but there are five I don\u2019t remember well anymore, so I just left those five out of the list. I also left out the innovative choose-your-own-adventure movie Bandersnatch, because I actually haven\u2019t seen it. Anyway, here are 28 episode reviews, along with ratings on a 10-point",

Cerebral cautionary tales about the excesses of technology take a while to work their way into people\u2019s hearts; the sheer grisly spectacle of the British Prime Minister being made to have sex with a pig on live TV is like a direct blow to the head. This episode\u2019s job was to get everyone talking about Black Mirror, and it succeeded. Interestingly, the reason this episode failed for me is because it was too British. The plot hinges on the kidnapping of a princess, and we Americans just find it hard to understand that sort of reverence for a royal family; I\u2019m just not sure there\u2019s any equivalent figure in the U.S. whose kidnapping would allow a random terrorist to extort the head of state. (It\u2019s also probably a reference to an actual scandal in the UK.) Most Black Mirror episodes either could happen in America, or feel like they could; this one felt foreign, and so it didn\u2019t resonate as much. But at the same time, \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d gave me a good sense of who was making this TV show: a Gen X British punk. I couldn\u2019t shake",

The climax of the episode is supposed to evoke shock and horror, but I also felt an undertone of glee, as the show\u2019s creator thumbed his nose at the British elite. \u201cFifteen Million Merits\u201d (10/10) This is one of my favorite Black Mirror episodes of all, for a number of reasons. First, the dystopia it creates is holistic and immersive. Most Black Mirror episodes have a 20-minutes-into-the-future feeling \u2014 they\u2019re basically the modern day with a few new technologies, usually introduced by one particular company or inventor. But \u201cFifteen Million Merits\u201d presents you with a whole futuristic landscape, where human beings have to pedal on bikes every day to create energy in order to be able to afford tiny rooms where they\u2019re constantly bombarded with advertisements on every wall. Their only hope of escape is to become a TV personality by winning a reality show. It\u2019s a never-ending living nightmare that all of the characters just sort of accept \u2014 which, of course, is how most of us treat most of the dystopian aspects of the real world around us.

The protagonist\u2019s desperate longing for the one woman who pays him a tiny bit of attention is both pathetic and relatable. Instead of rebelling against the insane system that keeps people penned in like cattle, the main character instead focuses on wishing he could have the one beautiful thing in his bleak, forsaken universe. Also, the ending is perfect and hilariously, darkly ironic \u2014 Black Mirror at its best. \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d (9/10) This is another of my favorites. The central conceit of Black Mirror is that human nature makes us abuse technology and use it to exploit and hurt each other. Technology thus holds up a mirror to reflect our own darker impulses; hence the name of the show. Sometimes, the show has to really stretch in order to make this motif fit the plot of an episode. Technologists often complain that Black Mirror is too pessimistic about technology, but the truth is that usually it\u2019s just too pessimistic about human nature. In reality, most people use most technologies for benign and productive purposes. But \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d is definitely not a stretch.

As you watch the episode\u2019s protagonist ruin his life, you keep mentally searching for something that you\u2019d do differently in his place \u2014 some critical error or misdeed that you would avoid. And there really just is none. The episode ends with a feeling of dread certainty that any normal person would fall into the same trap. \u201cThe Entire History of You\u201d thus functions not just as an emotionally powerful story, but as an effective warning about a real near-future technology \u2014 really a perfect execution of the basic Black Mirror formula. \u201cBe Right Back\u201d (6/10) This is one of the most popular and acclaimed episodes in all of Black Mirror, with some lists giving it the top spot. I just can\u2019t agree. It was pretty good, but I don\u2019t think it was one of the best. \u201cBe Right Back\u201d is about AI technology that lets people feel like they\u2019re interacting with their deceased loved ones.

Things go wrong in the TV version when the reanimation tech abruptly shifts from the digital to the physical \u2014 the company sends the woman a creepy android replica of her dead boyfriend. Unlike the chatbot, this android falls into the uncanny valley and ends up producing existential horror. I guess the message of this episode is that trying to bring your dead loved ones back from the dead is a bad idea. But the chatbot version of this seems not to cause many problems, both in the show and real life. So instead of some deeper message about trying to play God and cheat death and avoid the natural cycle of grief or whatever, the basic moral seems to be \u201cStick with chatbots and avoid creepy androids.\u201d Those are words to the wise, to be sure. \u201cWhite Bear\u201d (4/10) In this episode, a woman who\u2019s an accomplice to a murder is sentenced to a punishment where for 100 years, she has to live out the same punishment again and again.

And in the meantime you\u2019re paying all these human actors to act out these scenarios, which has to be insanely expensive \u2014 all just to punish one criminal. Honestly, jail is a lot worse than whatever this is, and cheaper too. \u201cThe Waldo Moment\u201d (3/10) In this episode, a goofy TV character named Waldo ends up running for office, and somehow this ends up with Waldo taking over the world and becoming the face of some kind of authoritarian regime. How this happens is never exactly shown. This episode is pretty forgettable, and the real-life clowns winning elections in America are far more dangerous than imaginary clowns winning them in a fantasy UK.

The technology in question is a social credit system, a bit along the lines of the system China claimed they were rolling out but didn\u2019t. In \u201cNosedive\u201d people are able to rate each other on basically anything, and these interpersonal ratings determine whether you\u2019re rich or poor. As you might expect, this society is filled with fake niceness. The protagonist ends up accidentally having her life ruined by this system, when one initial bad rating eventually causes so many problems in her life that she gets more bad ratings.

    "chunk": "(11/10) This was not only the best episode of Black Mirror by far, but also probably the single best hour of television I have ever watched in my life \u2014 an accomplishment so unique and profound that I still get shivers when I think about it. Even if every other episode of Black Mirror had been terrible, it would be worth watching the entire series just to get to \u201cSan Junipero\u201d. If you haven\u2019t seen it, please stop reading this review now and go watch it before getting spoilers. For those who saw it but don\u2019t remember, \u201cSan Junipero\u201d starts with a quiet, touching lesbian romance in a 1980s California beach town. Eventually you find out that they\u2019re in a simulation. One of the women, Yorkie \u2014 the shy one who had been a virgin before meeting the more experienced and outgoing Kelly \u2014 turns out to be a locked-in invalid who\u2019s trying to get doctor-assisted suicide so she can upload herself to the San Junipero simulation forever instead of just visiting occasionally. Kelly, meanwhile, lost her husband and daughter, and is now just enjoying herself in a retirement community while she waits to die. Eventually Yorkie convinces Kelly to upload herself too, and the two live (presumably) happily ever after in the digital afterlife. The story is incredibly heart-wrenching and perfectly executed (and it\u2019s based on song lyrics, which I always enjoy). But this is also the episode that changed Black Mirror forever, because it shifted the show\u2019s basic thesis about technology. In the end,",

But this is also the episode that changed Black Mirror forever, because it shifted the show\u2019s basic thesis about technology. In the end, simulated reality and personality upload allow both Yorkie and Kelly to live an unambiguously better life than they would have been able to live without the technology. In a show about techno-pessimism, \u201cSan Junipero\u201d stands out as one of the most techno-optimistic stories ever told. It\u2019s also an optimistic story about humanity. In its early episodes, Black Mirror usually depicted humans as weak, selfish, sadistic, or otherwise too flawed to be trusted with the power of technology. In \u201cSan Junipero\u201d, every character is good and kind, and they also end up being wise and brave. In most of his stories, Charlie Brooker seems to be testing his characters; in \u201cSan Junipero\u201d, finally, you get to see someone ace the test. This is enough to make \u201cSan Junipero\u201d the best episode of the entire show, but for me, there was something that made it even more powerful. As I watched the very last scene, where a robot places a capsule containing the protagonists\u2019 consciousness into a rack in a vast glittering server farm, I had a quasi-religious experience. Suddenly I felt the absolute conviction that this will happen. Over time, humans have gained the power to perform more and more of the miracles attributed to God in the Bible; one day, we\u2019ll be able to create Heaven",

We have a responsibility to the Universe too profound to even understand yet. Our future is lonely and bizarre and terrifying and full of infinite promise, and we have no possible choice but to embrace it. All that hit me in the final few seconds of \u201cSan Junipero\u201d. \u201cMen Against Fire\u201d (5/10) This is a rare episode of Black Mirror that\u2019s actually too optimistic about human nature. It\u2019s about genocidal soldiers who are tricked by the AR technology in their battle armor into thinking that their victims are disgusting and subhuman. Sadly, in real life, that sort of technological trickery isn\u2019t required \u2014 lots of people are plenty willing to commit genocide even when they see their victims clearly. \u201cHated in the Nation\u201d (8/10) This is probably the most underrated episode of Black Mirror. It\u2019s about a terrorist who offers Twitter users the (fake) chance to kill someone with their tweets, and who then kills every would-be murderer with a swarm of robotic bees.

The terrorist is supposed to be the bad guy, and of course it\u2019s pretty horrifying to see robotic bees crawling in people\u2019s ears and eating their brains. But the episode also makes a good point about how awful social media is. In the age of Twitter and similar apps, our public discussion has become ruled by the absolute worst people in our society, and it\u2019s hard to deny that this has degraded our democracy. It\u2019s the kind of actual, real-life technological dystopia that almost makes you think a swarm of robot death-bees would be preferable. \u201cUSS Callister \u201d (7/10) In this episode, a narcissistic game programmer uploads some innocent people into a Star Trek-like online simulation, so he can dominate and torture them. The digital clones fight back by getting their real-world selves to kill the evil engineer\u2019s real-world self, and then escape into an open-world RPG. This was a good episode, and the bad guy was really bad, but it was also a little cheesy. I did notice that the ending, while bizarre, was actually fairly happy \u2014 the regular folks escape into a video game universe instead of being tortured for eternity. This sort of weird, bittersweet ending turned out to be typical of many of Black Mirror\u2019s newer episodes, and I think it\u2019s often a good fit. \u201cHang the DJ\u201d (7/10) This is a cute episode about personality upload and online",

The protagonists fall in love in an online dating simulation, only to discover at the end that they\u2019re uploaded digital clones whose job is to test out the romantic compatibility of the real-life people they were cloned from. I liked the bittersweet ending; like \u201cUSS Callister\u201d, it showed how Black Mirror was changing from a downbeat show about the flawed nature of humanity into a show about the fundamental weirdness of technology. This evolution was probably kicked off by the success of \u201cSan Junipero\u201d, and it\u2019s a natural and good direction for the show to go in. But I have to say, I was a little disappointed that the digital clones were just wiped. It would have been more fun, and more bizarre, had they gotten to live out their own romance in the digital realm. \u201cMetalhead\u201d (10/10) This is the most terrifying episode of Black Mirror, by far. It\u2019s set in a world in which dog-like autonomous robots have killed off most humans and large animals. The story is very simple \u2014 it\u2019s just a band of humans desperately trying to survive another day, as they\u2019re hunted by the \u201cdogs\u201d.

Militaries around the world are testing robot combat dogs that look an awful lot like the ones in \u201cMetalhead\u201d. And with AI advancing by leaps and bounds, it\u2019s likely that at some point these robot death-dogs will be autonomous. It\u2019s pretty scary to think about all the ways that could go badly. \u201cBlack Museum\u201d (4/10) This is another dystopian tale about personality upload, set in a museum where a psychopath uploads and tortures people. The style of this episode is very cartoonish and over-the-top, and it ends up being a little cheesy and unconvincing compared to masterpieces like \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d. \u201cStriking Vipers\u201d (7/10) This was a really interesting and fairly poignant episode about two guys who have sex in a video game but who aren\u2019t interested in each other in real life. It\u2019s a neat exploration of how sexuality will change from things like virtual worlds and AI. \u201cRachel, Jack, and Ashley Too\u201d (8/10) This is another upbeat story, about an AI doll modeled after a pop star. The doll helps the pop star to escape the control of her evil aunt, and eventually to begin a much more fulfilled, independent life as a rock star.

The plot centers around her trying to get out of the TV show, using increasingly dramatic and hilarious methods. At the very end, more layers of technological wackiness are revealed, and the whole thing gets even zanier. The ending is of the \u201cbittersweet/weird\u201d type that has become the hallmark of the later seasons of Black Mirror. Anyway, I love this one \u2014 it made me laugh more than any other episode of the show, by far. \u201cLoch Henry\u201d (7/10) In its 6th season, Black Mirror tried branching out in new directions. One of these was mystery; \u201cLoch Henry\u201d isn\u2019t sci-fi at all, but simply a murder mystery set in a small Scottish town. It\u2019s very well-executed, but feels a bit out of place in the show. \u201cBeyond the Sea\u201d (5/10) This is a slow, depressing episode about astronauts who send their consciousness back to Earth to occupy remote bodies.

The plot is workmanlike and fine, but nothing here blew me away. \u201cDemon 79\u201d (3/10) In its sixth season, Black Mirror started to experiment with new themes, genres, formats, etc. In the season\u2019s final episode, it sarcastically rebranded itself as \u201cRed Mirror\u201d and told a fantasy story about demons killing people and the world getting destroyed. The story is OK as far as it goes, but it didn\u2019t have much of Black Mirror in it; I don\u2019t think that fans really come to this show just to see awful things happen to characters. If the showrunners had kept taking Black Mirror in this direction, I would have given up on it. Fortunately, it didn\u2019t, and the seventh season represented a spectacular return to form. \u201cCommon People\u201d (9/10) The first episode of Black Mirror\u2019s most recent season is a near-perfect return to the series\u2019 roots. It\u2019s a dark, sad tale of a loving, devoted working-class couple who are slowly ground down and destroyed by the callousness of a software-as-a-service business model. The wife has a brain tumor, and can only survive by buying a subscription from a company that operates her brain remotely.

The husband works himself to the bone at his blue-collar job, and eventually resorts to humiliating himself on a livestreaming service for tips. At the end it\u2019s just too much and the sweet couple kills themselves. \u201cCommon People\u201d is classic Black Mirror \u2014 the story of a powerful new technology corrupted and misused by flawed, greedy humans. The tenderness and innocence and earnest devotion of the couple makes their fate at the hands of callous capitalism all the more bitter. However, the timing of this episode blunted the impact a little bit. It was released right after Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, and just as Trump was defying a Supreme Court order to bring back a wrongfully arrested man from a foreign torture-dungeon. Watching a dystopia about a biotech company extracting fees from working-class people was still powerful, but perhaps not as powerful as it would have been if far worse things hadn\u2019t been unfolding in the real world at the time. \u201cBete Noire\u201d (7/10) This was a very fun and well-acted episode, although the technology was a little silly. \u201cHotel Reverie\u201d (7/10) The last 20 or 25 minutes of the extra-long \u201cHotel Reverie\u201d are a",

The romance is extremely touching, but the plot that the episode uses to get the protagonists into that situation is pretty laughably unrealistic, and makes it a bit hard to suspend disbelief at times. It also drags on for a little too long. But the payoff of the doomed, bittersweet romance in the last part of the episode is worth it. \u201cPlaything\u201d (5/10) Finally, Black Mirror did an episode about AI becoming sentient and taking over the world. They even referenced Roko\u2019s Basilisk. But most of the episode is in flashback/voiceover, which I thought was a bit of a clunky way to tell the story. \u201cEulogy\u201d (10/10) Classic Black Mirror is about flawed humans misusing technology. But \u201cEulogy\u201d is very different \u2014 it\u2019s about technology helping a flawed human, giving him a chance for closure and peace of mind that he never otherwise would have had. The plot is about an old man trying to remember his deceased ex-girlfriend, using an AI assistant and a technology that lets him walk around inside old photographs.

The episode was hauntingly beautiful, slow, poignant, and ultimately bittersweet without being weird at all. I hope this episode gets remembered as the triumph it is. \u201cUSS Callister : Into Infinity\u201d (8/10) This episode is a direct sequel to \u201cUSS Callister\u201d from the fourth season. The plot picks right up where it left off, with our digitally cloned heroes zooming around inside an open-world video game. More hijinks ensue, as one of their real-world versions tries to rescue them. The sequel is even funnier and zanier than the original. Anyway, \u201cUSS Callister: Into Infinity\u201d caps a seventh season that really revived Black Mirror after a disappointing set of experiments a couple of years before. Although a little bit of this was a return to the series\u2019 roots (with \u201cCommon People\u201d), most of this season\u2019s episodes represented a shift toward a more balanced \u2014 dare I say, more realistic \u2014 view of how technology changes the world.

I made it clear that I didn\u2019t think this scenario was very likely, but it was at least plausible. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t pan out that way. In fact, in some ways, Trump 2.0 has proven to be not only worse than his first term in office, but worse than almost anyone expected during his campaign. The tariffs he has already announced, for example, have been far higher than the (already substantial) numbers he promised as a candidate, and more focused on Mexico and Canada. The policy uncertainty created by his on-again, off-again tariff announcements, and by the divisions within his administration, have also exceeded even the level of incompetence most of his detractors could predict. It\u2019s now time to talk about worst-case scenarios. When we think about the worst-case scenario for Trump\u2019s economy, we shouldn\u2019t just think about the worst possible effects of his current policies; we need to think about how much damage he could plausibly do with additional bad moves. We need to skate to where the proverbial puck is headed. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 Trump\u2019s tariffs are already very bad, and will cause grinding deindustrialization, a macroeconomic slowdown, and possibly higher inflation.

If the Fed printed a bunch of money\u2026it would bring long-term interest rates back down\u2026So Trump could try to exert pressure on the Fed to do this\u2026But there\u2019s one big problem with that strategy: inflation\u2026If Trump were to try printing money\u2026it would likely just cause even more capital to flee the country, requiring even more Fed money-printing to push yields back down. It\u2019s hard to see how that wouldn\u2019t result in spiraling inflation.

Bloomberg reports: Donald Trump is studying whether he\u2019s able to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, his top economist said Friday, a day after the president publicly criticized the head of the central bank for not moving fast enough to slash interest rates\u2026Hassett went on to suggest that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats. Trump wants to get rid of Powell because Trump wants to cut interest rates, and Powell is refusing to do so.

They\u2019re not mutually exclusive, of course \u2014 you can have both, one can lead to the other and vice versa, and the economic pressures that lead to the two are often similar. It\u2019s important to understand the chain of events that could lead from the end of the Fed\u2019s independence \u2014 in combination with Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 to hyperinflation and/or sovereign default.

Regular Noahpinion readers will know that I\u2019m not very excited about a second Trump term. I don\u2019t think the next four years are going to be hell on Earth or that they\u2019ll lead to the collapse of the nation, but I do think Trump is probably going to degrade our institutions, foment chaos, appease our enemies overseas, and appoint a lot of very unqualified people. BUT, I also do have to admit that Trump\u2019s first term turned out much better than I expected! Trump did foment social and political chaos, but consider the following: The economy demonstrated strong growth, with workers at the bottom of the distribution reaping especially large wage gains. Thanks to Trump\u2019s rhetoric, the U.S. belatedly woke up to the various threats posed by China, and realized that unilateral free trade has many drawbacks. Trump did not lock Hillary Clinton up, or persecute his political enemies in general. Trump did great on Covid relief spending, carrying American households through the pandemic and propelling a rapid economic recovery after the pandemic.

Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed was the best Covid vaccine development effort in the world, creating new and highly effective vaccines in a very short period of time, and saving a very large number of lives. Very few U.S. government institutions suffered long-lasting damage as a result of Trump. That\u2019s not the best-case scenario for how Trump\u2019s first term could have turned out, but it\u2019s very far from the worst. All in all, if you told me in November 2016 that this is how Trump\u2019s term would go, I would have breathed a sigh of relief (well, except for learning that we were going to have a giant pandemic, but that was hardly Trump\u2019s fault). So best-case scenarios are not pie-in-the-sky magical thinking. The second Trump presidency hasn\u2019t been a disaster yet, and there\u2019s a chance it won\u2019t be one. Here are ten pieces of what I see as the most optimistic plausible scenario. The economy continues to do well There\u2019s no evidence that economic expansions \u201cdie of old age\u201d. Other than the brief weird interruption of Covid in 2020, the U.S. economy has been in perpetual expansion for the last 12 years or more. There\u2019s a decent chance this will continue. The biggest threat to any economic expansion \u2014 a financial crisis \u2014 just doesn\u2019t seem to be in the offing. There has been no big buildup of household debt in the U.S. financial system.

The rate hikes of 2022-24 caused no more than a few modestly sized bank failures that were cleaned up quickly and easily. That means the main threat to the economy is inflation. People really hate inflation for its own sake, and also if it rises too much, the Fed could have to raise rates to levels that would choke off the economic expansion. But although inflation did tick up a bit this month, overall inflation expectations remain low and stable: In the best-case scenario, Trump does nothing to upset this apple cart. He will raise tariffs, but much of the effect could be cancelled out by changes in exchange rates. His threats to curb or end Fed independence \u2014 forcing interest rates lower, which would be very inflationary \u2014 could turn out to be just a bluff. And Trump\u2019s advisors, like Elon Musk, could prevail upon him to cut deficits, removing another inflationary pressure. In this scenario, inflation will remain low all on its own, and the economic expansion will likely continue uninterrupted, bringing further wage gains for Americans across the economic spectrum. Unrest continues to fall Unrest was the worst thing about Trump\u2019s first term, but there are some signs that this history won\u2019t repeat itself in the second.

Nor have rightists triumphantly marched through the streets as they did in Charlottesville in 2017. In general, the left-right street battles that characterized Trump\u2019s first term have not reappeared. Two people did try to assassinate Trump during his campaign, but these were lone-wolf individuals without a clear political ideology. There has been no recent outbreak of hate crimes, mass shootings, or stochastic terrorism, as there was in 2016-17. It\u2019s possible that America has simply become exhausted with the constant talk of civil war, coups, and so on. The Palestine protesters are still marching, but they\u2019re small in number and the country has tuned them out. Meanwhile, anger over racism, sexism, etc. seems to be ebbing from newspapers, TV, the internet, and scientific papers.

In other words, Trump or no Trump, America may be headed for an era of social quiescence \u2014 a grumpy, bitter, quiescence, perhaps, but nothing like the turmoil of the previous decade. Tariffs on allies are a bluff Trump has threatened to slap big tariffs on U.S. allies like Mexico and Canada. That would be bad, because it would hurt American manufacturing, by making it harder to get parts and materials. But it\u2019s possible that this is a bluff.

It\u2019s possible this term will go much the same way, and American manufacturers will be able to get the parts and materials they need. Trump\u2019s deregulatory effort helps the U.S. grow faster During the Biden years, it became painfully apparent that certain types of regulation \u2014 especially land-use permitting \u2014 were strangling American industry. Some Democrats tried to reform permitting in order to facilitate the transition to green energy, but were largely foiled by progressive factions of their coalition. Trump and his people will not be hamstrung by having pro-regulation members of their own governing coalition. Trump will follow the typical Republican pattern of appointing anti-regulation people to the civil service, and fighting regulations in court. Having the deregulation-minded Elon Musk on his side may make Trump pay more attention to the issue than he did during his first term.

That would be a tragedy, since these laws have been more effective at reindustrializing America than any other policy tried thus far. But it\u2019s possible Trump could be bluffing! Instead, he might decide to keep the policies in place, but make just enough changes to slap his name on them and take credit for them. This would obviously make Democrats mad, but it would preserve these very important policies. And in fact, some of the changes Trump might make could be positive ones! Onerous contracting requirements \u2014 for example, requirements to use a large percent of union labor for government-supported projects even in states without many unions \u2014 have proven to be one of the main things holding industrial policy back in America. If Trump simply stripped those requirements from the CHIPS Act and IRA and then left them otherwise alone \u2014 or added his own initiatives on top \u2014 it would give a big boost to American industry.

And it\u2019s possible that Trump will replace these wacky appointees with competent conservatives. For example, Trump just nominated Jim O\u2019Neill, former CEO of the Thiel Foundation, to be deputy head of HHS, right under RFK Jr. If RFK resigns, O\u2019Neill would be the most likely person to take the top spot, and would probably do an infinitely better job. And it\u2019s possible that this could become a pattern throughout the entire administration. Elon or others restrain Trump from fiscal profligacy The biggest economic danger of Trump\u2019s second term is inflation. Government deficits are one driver of inflation, for two reasons. First, they stimulate aggregate demand by putting money into consumers\u2019 hands. Second, they pressure the Fed to keep rates low in order to help sustain government borrowing, and low rates are inflationary. Trump has promised huge amounts of tax cuts, without concomitant spending increases.

Musk correctly identifies deficits as a driver of inflation: If this attitude prevails in the Trump camp, fiscal hawkishness may thus return to the Republican party under Trump, after a 44-year absence. It would probably involve cutting benefits for the poor, but it would be more fiscally responsible than Trump\u2019s plan for vast tax cuts for the rich. Trump takes no federal action on abortion Perhaps the most consequential change to American society that happened as a result of Trump\u2019s first term was that abortion became illegal in some states (thanks to Supreme Court judges that Trump appointed). Some in the GOP now want to enact a federal abortion ban, that would make it illegal throughout the country. However, Trump has promised to veto such a bill. He probably realizes how unpopular it would be. The best-case scenario is that he follows through on this promise, and continues his record of being moderate on abortion rights.

That would certainly end the war! But there are reasons for Trump not to go this route. MAGA rhetoric on this issue has always claimed (falsely) that America is at war in Ukraine. But if that were true, it would mean that if Ukraine were overrun, America would have \u201clost\u201d a war.

All the headlines would declare \u201cAmerica just lost another war!\u201d, and Trump would take the blame. In fact, Trump seems to be appointing at least a few hawkish people who would be very unhappy with the feeling that America had lost a war to Russia. General Keith Kellogg, whom Trump just named as special to Ukraine and Russia, and Sebastian Gorka, whom Trump just appointed as a counter-terrorism advisor, have both talked about possibly escalating U.S. aid to Ukraine.

If the Ukrainians refuse to cede territory to Russia, Trump could threaten to withdraw aid completely. Thus, he might be able to force a resolution in which Ukraine cedes some territory to Russia but survives mostly intact as a nation. This would represent a technical loss for Ukraine in the war, but in the long-term strategic sense, it would be a nation-defining victory. Just like Finland in the Winter War, Ukraine would lose territory but ultimately guarantee its independence as a nation. Russia, meanwhile, might agree to this in order to save face, preserve and reconstitute its military forces, and bolster its flagging economy. And European countries would gain time to sort out their dysfunctional domestic politics and build up their defenses against the Russian threat. In fact, this outcome would probably be the best for all concerned at this point, and if Trump can actually manage to bring it about, it will be a major success.

First the Rust Belt and then the China Shock hollowed out the manufacturing workforce \u2014 employment plunged, and output stagnated. And yet neither Bush nor Obama seemed to have any plan for how to make it happen. Trump talked a big game about bringing manufacturing back to America, but his signature initiative \u2014 the tariffs \u2014 didn\u2019t make any headway in terms of reshoring. Trump\u2019s attempt to harangue American companies into no longer shipping jobs overseas, and his bungled attempt to get Foxconn to build a factory in rural Wisconsin, were even less effective. There was no perceptible increase in factory construction, manufacturing output, or employment. Then came Biden.

A massive factory construction boom began almost immediately after the bills were signed: Note that this graph is adjusted for the cost of new industrial building construction. So this isn\u2019t a graph of inflation we\u2019re looking at \u2014 this is a huge increase in actual construction. You can also see a big bump in construction employment in the nonresidential sector \u2014 despite the commercial real estate bust! What kind of factories are being built? The new spending is mostly on chips and batteries: So this is clearly a result of Biden\u2019s two big bills. The U.S., which so often finds itself unable to build anything, is actually building something. It\u2019s still early days, of course. In fact, manufacturing output and employment haven\u2019t risen yet! Building factories takes time. There are still many hurdles yet to overcome, and it\u2019s a learning process. But finally, a President actually did something to restore U.S. manufacturing. After all those years of talk, someone did something, and that someone was Joe Biden.

Plenty of people say that we shouldn\u2019t be focusing on manufacturing at all \u2014 that we should simply step back and let the free market do its work, and that industrial policy is wasteful. We won\u2019t know for a while whether they\u2019re right. But what we do know is that China is ramping up its manufacturing machine to an incredible degree; in the face of that competition, we can either simply stop making anything in tradable manufactured goods and let our main rival do it all, while we specialize in agriculture and finance, or we can try to fight back. \u201cFight back\u201d is obviously the correct option. The usefulness of an economy is not measured purely in dollars of profit; an industrial economy is absolutely necessary in order to sustain a modern military that can keep us safe in the face of unprecedented external threats. Finance and agriculture cannot, by themselves, defend us against Chinese drones, missiles, and warships. Only manufacturing can do that. Semiconductors and batteries are incredibly crucial to defense manufacturing \u2014 chips are essential for every military device, especially precision weapons, and batteries power many of the drones that are taking over the battlefield. And of course, batteries are essential for fighting climate change, too. In other words, Biden picked exactly the right industries to support.

With regards to China, Biden has done more than any other President \u2014 by far.

Sweden and Norway even emerged from neutrality to join. Thus, Russia, instead of conquering Ukraine and facing a divided, fractious Europe with its Soviet-era military hardware intact, now holds only a fifth of Ukraine and faces a united Europe, with much of its Soviet inheritance lying in ruins. That\u2019s due to the valiance of the Ukrainian defenders and the financial aid of the Europeans, but Biden\u2019s timely commitment of weapons played the decisive role. For that alone, Biden is the best foreign policy President since George H.W. Bush. And U.S. support for Ukraine had another salutary effect \u2014 it was a wake-up call about the fact that the U.S. defense-industrial base has badly atrophied.

But that having been said, Biden has done a much better job than Trump would have done in terms of navigating a sensible middle path through the thorny conflict: Of course the leftist kids give Biden no credit for this, but the leftist kids are silly.

And although some of the factors causing inflation were beyond Biden\u2019s control, his spending probably did exacerbate the problem a bit, as I said before. But Biden did a lot to help quell the inflation, too. First, and most importantly, he reappointed Jerome Powell as Fed chair. Many progressives had worried that Powell was too hawkish, and would cause a recession with too many interest rate hikes. But Biden stayed the course, and that turned out to be the right move. Powell\u2019s rate hikes helped bring inflation down \u2014 not all the way to the 2% target, but enough so that real wages have started to grow again and are now on their pre-pandemic trend: In fact, Biden did one other thing to help bring down inflation: He increased oil production. Although he came into office expecting to curb fracking in the name of the climate, the Ukraine war prompted an about-face. Biden opened up drilling, and the U.S. now produces more oil than any country ever has in the history of the world. Cheaper oil doesn\u2019t just make gasoline cheaper (although it does do that). It allows all kinds of businesses to move people and goods around more cheaply, allowing to produce things more cheaply \u2014 which lowers inflation.

Both of those were in the face of pressure from his own party, and showed a lot of courage and leadership. Less spending on health insurance and student debt would have taken a little of the edge off inflation in 2021, but Biden\u2019s actions to bring down inflation in 2022 and 2023 outweigh the mistake. Oh, and Biden\u2019s administration also just casually stopped a banking crisis in its tracks back in early 2023. It was such a flawless victory that almost no one even remembers the panic! Now the U.S. economy is humming on all cylinders. Wages are rising, growth is fast, productivity is growing, young people are doing better than their parents, wealth is up, employment is great, and so on. This Goldilocks situation won\u2019t last forever, but it took some skillful macroeconomic management to get us here, and Biden \u2014 and the people in his administration \u2014 deserve some of the credit. Another big thing Biden got right was crime.

In 2020, many progressives were calling to defund the police; Biden fought against this idea from day 1. In fact, he has consistently supported hiring a lot more cops, together with various other measures to curb violence. And in fact, more cops have been hired; there are now more police working in America than ever before. Cops do help prevent crime \u2014 sorry, police abolitionists! \u2014 so Biden\u2019s steadfast refusal to entertain notions of defunding the police probably gets a bit of the credit for the drop in crime. So on the daily issues that affect Americans the most, Joe Biden has generally been an effective and responsible leader. And he has done this at the same time that he has strengthened U.S. alliances, halted Russia in its tracks, and begun a needed transformation of U.S. economic policy. Not bad for an 81 year old, eh? It\u2019s all about hiring good help. Anyway, given that record, I\u2019m strongly inclined to keep Biden around for another 4 years.

The administration later admitted that his arrest had been an error \u2014 Garcia had been granted court protection against deportation, but Trump\u2019s people grabbed him anyway. A few days ago, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a lower court\u2019s order that the Trump administration \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Trump initially said he would respect the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.

Bukele, meeting with Trump in the Oval Office, argued that his government also doesn\u2019t have the power to return Abrego Garcia; given that Bukele has already returned several people to the U.S., it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to whether Bukele is simply lying, or whether Abrego Garcia is already dead.

Others didn\u2019t even have any tattoos, and were arrested for no apparent reason. It\u2019s not clear why the Trump administration is doing this.

Maybe they\u2019ve really convinced themselves that all of the people they arrested are gang members. Who knows. But what\u2019s clear is that this is brutal and lawless behavior \u2014 the kind of arbitrary arrest and punishment that\u2019s common in authoritarian regimes. The second thing that should scare you is the lawlessness. The Trump administration insists it didn\u2019t defy the Supreme Court, arguing that simply removing any barriers to Abrego Garcia\u2019s return means that they\u2019re complying with the court order to \u201cfacilitate\u201d that return.

If so, it means that due process and the rule of law in America are effectively dead; the President can simply do anything to anyone, for any reason.

The third reason the Abrego Garcia case should worry you is that the Trump administration probably intends to go much further.

That is the power of a dictator. A few weeks ago I wrote a post asking when, exactly, we could conclude that America had become a dictatorship: It seems clear that if Trump actually does have the ability to arbitrarily send any American to an overseas prison with zero due process and zero oversight by any court of law, then we do, in fact, live in a dictatorship.

Surprisingly, I think Friedman is more right than Tyler here. I\u2019ve written a bit about this topic over the past few years, and I think that when we look back on the 21st century, we\u2019ll probably call it the Chinese Century \u2014 or at least, the first half of it. But the reason I say this is because what it means for a century to \u201cbelong\u201d to a specific country will change from what it meant in the 20th \u2014 and often in ways that will not be very pleasant. What does it mean for a century to \u201cbelong\u201d to a country? The 20th century often gets called the \u201cAmerican century\u201d, but there\u2019s no one reason why. It\u2019s just sort of a gestalt impression that the U.S. was the most important country during that century. There were lots of dimensions in which this was true: The U.S. had the largest economy in the world, and was the dominant manufacturing nation. The U.S. was militarily dominant, having the world\u2019s most powerful military for almost the entire century. The U.S. was one of the richest economies, setting the standard for what a modern lifestyle should look like.

The U.S. was a technological leader, producing by far the largest share of the scientific discoveries, breakthrough inventions, and commercial products that changed the world. The U.S. was culturally dominant, through its output of movies, music, television, games, fashion, and ideas. The U.S. was geopolitically central; it played a key role in creating and sustaining various international institutions, created the world\u2019s largest and most powerful network of alliances, and provided global public goods like freedom of the seas. The U.S. was historically central, playing the most important role in shaping many of the key global events of the 20th century \u2014 the World Wars, decolonization, the Cold War, and globalization. In fact, I would argue that our whole modern notion of assigning centuries to countries was pattered after America\u2019s unusual importance across nearly every single domain in the 20th century. It\u2019s hard to think of other historical examples where one country has had such broad-spectrum dominance. The closest comparison has got to be Britain in the 19th century, which gave birth to the Industrial Revolution and built a globe-spanning empire. But even the UK was never as militarily or culturally dominant as America was in the 20th century. As for older comparisons, only the Mongol Empire in the 13th and early 14th centuries really measures up.

The globe was usually just too fragmented, and technological progress too slow, for one country or empire to overshadow all the others. Even the Roman Empire, the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Tang Dynasty were more regional superpowers than global ones. Anyway, the point here is that there\u2019s no reason that we should believe, a priori, that the 21st century will be dominated by anyone the way America dominated the 20th. The historical norm is multipolarity, with different countries and empires having modest leads in various different dimensions for various periods of time. Now, you can argue that globalization and continuous technological progress are both here to stay, meaning that future centuries are permanently more likely to have one dominant country. I think that\u2019s probably true to some extent. But as I\u2019ll explain, I also think that the nature of both globalization and technological progress are changing, in ways that will bias the 21st century toward multipolarity. And some of these changes will result from the power transition from the U.S. to China. Simply put, 20th century America invented the game that it won, whereas China will use its power to invent (and win) a different sort of game.

But I\u2019m not much of a cultural determinist; I think technology and institutions tend to matter more. Here, the differences outweigh the similarities. One area where China already far surpasses America is in state capacity. This is from a post I wrote back in 2023: In his book China\u2019s Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know (which is excellent and which I heavily recommend), Arthur Kroeber offers a grand unified theory of the country\u2019s economy \u2014 that it\u2019s good at rapidly and effectively mobilizing lots of resources, but bad at using those resources in an optimally efficient way. So in the case of say, building too many apartments, or failed Belt and Road projects, or wasteful corporate subsidies, the lack of efficiency can really bite. But if we\u2019re talking about building the world\u2019s biggest high-speed rail system, or creating a world-beating car industry from scratch, or building massive amounts of green energy, then China\u2019s resource-mobilizing approach can accomplish things on a scale no other country has ever accomplished before\u2026 Remember a few years ago, when a bunch of people were sharing this map of a hypothetical U.S. high speed rail system?\u2026Of course, the map and others like it were pure fantasy; in 15 years, California\u2019s much-ballyhooed high speed rail project has managed to almost",

That\u2019s the extent of the U.S.\u2019 high speed rail prowess\u2026But in China, they actually built the map!\u2026In the last 15 years, China, starting from scratch, built a high-speed rail network almost as twice as long as all other high-speed rail networks in the world, combined. I\u2019m not exaggerating; you can look these numbers up on Wikipedia. As of last year, China had 42,000 km of high-speed railways in operation, with another 28,000 km planned. That\u2019s compared to just 2,727 km in Japan, with its famous shinkansen. The U.S. used to have much higher state capacity than it does now, back in the middle of the 20th century \u2014 it was able to outproduce all other nations during World War 2, build the interstate highway system, and so on. But modern Chinese state capacity vastly exceeds even America\u2019s peak. What other nation could have maintained the kind of draconian, micro-managed Covid lockdowns that China kept all the way through 2022? Of course, past a certain point, these lockdowns were probably counterproductive, and they were certainly dystopian.

China is also bigger than the U.S., and so if its economy continues to mature, it will eventually be even more economically dominant. The UN predicts that by 2030, China will represent 45% of all global manufacturing \u2014 higher than the U.S. ever achieved except for a brief moment after World War 2. But also recall that manufacturing is falling as a percent of China\u2019s GDP, as service industries grow. So unless China somehow turns out to be uniquely weak in the service sector, we can probably expect its overall economic dominance to be just as big as America\u2019s was, or bigger. Nor do I think the loss of U.S. export markets will hurt China much. Tyler asks: \u201cWhere will China sell the rising output from their factories?\u201d. The answer to that question is \u201cChina\u201d. Contrary to popular belief, China is not that export-intensive of an economy, compared to the likes of France, Germany, or South Korea: China had a brief period of export-oriented growth in the 2000s, but that\u2019s basically over. Now, China sells most of what it produces to Chinese people. Even the vaunted \u201cSecond China Shock\u201d is mostly an overflow phenomenon; for example, China has become the world\u2019s top car exporter, but the vast majority of the vehicles it makes are for domestic consumption.

In this sense, China is becoming more like the 20th century U.S. \u2014 a very large economy that has some prominent exports but is fundamentally domestically focused. Lack of demand from America is highly unlikely to cripple or even substantively reduce China\u2019s economic progress, especially as the Chinese economy shifts to services. (And no, China\u2019s current real estate bust will probably not derail its economic rise, any more than the Great Depression permanently derailed America\u2019s.) With economic dominance will come military dominance. The smaller nations of the world are probably more able to resist conquest and domination by their larger neighbors now, thanks to nuclear proliferation and the shift of technologies toward tactical defense (basically, drones and missiles blow up vehicles, and guns shoot down drones). But China\u2019s size and manufacturing strength will allow it to overwhelm any nation that resists it, and that threat will be enough to overawe most. But the similarities probably stop there. China\u2019s vast size, smaller resource endowments, and inefficiently high level of government involvement in the economy will probably stop it from attaining the kind of world-beating living standards that America enjoyed (and still enjoys, at least for the moment).

In terms of technological leadership, China will certainly shine \u2014 but not in the same way America did. In a post last month, I argued that China overall is a highly innovative country, but that due to weak IP protections and other institutional factors, its innovations tend to be a blizzard of incremental improvements with few dramatic breakthroughs: To American ears, this sounds like a condemnation of China\u2019s system, but to China\u2019s leaders this is probably just fine. If China simply appropriates or copies any new invention and scales it up more efficiently than anyone else can, it still comes out on top. And my sense is that coming out on top is far more important to China\u2019s leadership than furthering the aggregate progress of human knowledge and prosperity. If weak IP protections discourage breakthrough discovery and invention all over the world, so what? That just reduces the risk that the rule of the Chinese Communist Party will be destabilized by the emergence of new techno-economic paradigms. Some might argue that AI will change this equation.

If so, the world will enjoy a technological golden age. But even in that scenario, China will likely be able to appropriate, scale, and commercialize all of those innovations. It will still be the technological leader, just not the kind the U.S. was. In the cultural realm, I expect China to be more isolated and less influential than America was. Partly this is because of language \u2014 English is far more internationalized than Chinese will ever be (though AI will erode this barrier significantly). But partly it\u2019s because of social control. China is a deeply repressive nation, with universal surveillance, fine-grained media and speech control, and ubiquitous censorship. That\u2019s the kind of society where only anodyne, cautious artistry can flourish, except in tiny subcultural pockets too small for the government to worry about. China\u2019s leaders will also probably remain paranoid about allowing in foreign ideas. They will continue to use the Great Firewall to \u201cprotect\u201d Chinese people from the memes and ideas produced by the rest of the world.

Chinese tech products like TikTok will have an influence on global culture, but the key content will be produced elsewhere. As for geopolitics, I think Tyler is certainly right that China will provide fewer global public goods than America did. It will be less interested in creating freedom of the seas for other nations, and more narrowly concerned with protecting its own trade. Its military will make sure energy supplies reach Chinese shores, but probably won\u2019t be interested in making energy globally abundant. Research is another example; China\u2019s government will make sure China dominates every frontier technology, but won\u2019t care as much about expanding the frontier. And global security is yet another; for all the sneers directed at America\u2019s self-appointed role of \u201cworld police\u201d, it was more willing to stand up to regional conquerors than China has proven so far.
