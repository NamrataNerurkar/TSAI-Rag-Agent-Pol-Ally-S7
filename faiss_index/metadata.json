I made it clear that I didn\u2019t think this scenario was very likely, but it was at least plausible. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t pan out that way. In fact, in some ways, Trump 2.0 has proven to be not only worse than his first term in office, but worse than almost anyone expected during his campaign. The tariffs he has already announced, for example, have been far higher than the (already substantial) numbers he promised as a candidate, and more focused on Mexico and Canada. The policy uncertainty created by his on-again, off-again tariff announcements, and by the divisions within his administration, have also exceeded even the level of incompetence most of his detractors could predict. It\u2019s now time to talk about worst-case scenarios. When we think about the worst-case scenario for Trump\u2019s economy, we shouldn\u2019t just think about the worst possible effects of his current policies; we need to think about how much damage he could plausibly do with additional bad moves. We need to skate to where the proverbial puck is headed. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 Trump\u2019s tariffs are already very bad, and will cause grinding deindustrialization, a macroeconomic slowdown, and possibly higher inflation. They may even cause continued capital flight, which would raise U.S. borrowing costs, hurt the economy even more, and make the national debt less sustainable.

Let me just quote my own post a bit: I suspect Trump will do something more like what he used to do as a businessman when his debt went bad \u2014 look for a cheap bailout, and if one doesn\u2019t emerge, declare bankruptcy\u2026 If foreigners are headed for the exits, there\u2019s only one entity with the ability to bail out the U.S. government, and that\u2019s the Fed. If the Fed printed a bunch of money\u2026it would bring long-term interest rates back down\u2026So Trump could try to exert pressure on the Fed to do this\u2026But there\u2019s one big problem with that strategy: inflation\u2026If Trump were to try printing money\u2026it would likely just cause even more capital to flee the country, requiring even more Fed money-printing to push yields back down. It\u2019s hard to see how that wouldn\u2019t result in spiraling inflation.

Just a few days after I wrote that post, it\u2019s already looking like Trump might be even worse than what I predicted. I suggested Trump might replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when Powell\u2019s term is up next year. Instead, Trump has suddenly begun talking about firing Powell immediately. Bloomberg reports: Donald Trump is studying whether he\u2019s able to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, his top economist said Friday, a day after the president publicly criticized the head of the central bank for not moving fast enough to slash interest rates\u2026Hassett went on to suggest that the Fed under Powell, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, had acted politically to benefit Democrats. Trump wants to get rid of Powell because Trump wants to cut interest rates, and Powell is refusing to do so.

Firing Powell in order to appoint a more pliant Fed chair who will lower interest rates at the President\u2019s behest would spell the end of central bank independence in the United States.

As I wrote in my earlier post, there are basically two truly nightmarish economic scenarios here: 1) Hyperinflation, and 2) Sovereign debt default. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive, of course \u2014 you can have both, one can lead to the other and vice versa, and the economic pressures that lead to the two are often similar. It\u2019s important to understand the chain of events that could lead from the end of the Fed\u2019s independence \u2014 in combination with Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 to hyperinflation and/or sovereign default. All too often, commentators just sort of wave their hands and tell us that if we mess with the Fed and the dollar and the other pillars of the U.S. financial system, we could get those nightmare outcomes. The commentators aren\u2019t wrong. But it\u2019s actually not too hard to understand why these things could happen if Trump keeps pushing in the direction he\u2019s been pushing. So far, I still consider these extreme scenarios to be pretty unlikely, given all the people in the U.S. who would stand to lose catastrophically if either were to occur.

Here are the big trends in a nutshell. The red line (measured on the right-hand axis) shows that the average age of the global poulation was about 27 years back in 1980, is now up to about 35 years ,and is headed above 40 years in a few decades. The blue line shows average annual population growth. From 1980 to the present, it fell from 1.8% to about 0.8%, and it\u2019s headed toward negative population growth later this century. Of cousre, this decline in population growth isn\u2019t distributed equally. This figure shows the timing at which countries start to experience a decline in the \u201cworking-age\u201d population, defined here as ages 15-64. As you can see, Germany, France, Italy, and Japan were already experiencing a declin in the working-age population before the year 2000. Since 2000, the US, Canada, China, Korea, and Brazil have joined the club. In the 2030s, India and Indonesia will start to experience a declining working-age population. By later in the century, the pattern is projected to reach countries across Africa, like Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, and others. Does a decline in working-age population necessarily mean a corresponding decline in economic output? Maybe not. There will be more workers with greater experience.

In addition, people seem to be maintaining their cognitive sharpness and physical health later in life, which is not only a good thing in and of itself, but also increases the chance that they will continue contributing to the economy as workers for a few years longer. The IMF rreport notes: Alongside increases in longevity, the functional capacity of older individuals has improved over time. More recent cohorts of older individuals are physically stronger and cognitively abler than earlier cohorts at the same age. Notably, when cognitive capacities are the focus, \u201cthe 70s are the new 50s\u201d: Data from a sample of 41 advanced and emerging market economies indicate that, on average, a person who was 70 in 2022 had the same cognitive ability as a 53-yearold in 2000. Over the course of a decade, this pace of improvement in cognitive abilities is associated with an increase of approximately 20 percentage points in the likelihood that individuals remain engaged in the labor market, either by working or actively seeking employment, along with an increase of about six hours in average weekly hours worked and a 30 percent rise in labor earnings, conditional on being employed.

The other day, the Trump administration arrested an innocent Salvadoran man named Kilmar Abrego Garcia and sent him to a prison in El Salvador with no trial or even any accusation of a crime. The administration later admitted that his arrest had been an error \u2014 Garcia had been granted court protection against deportation, but Trump\u2019s people grabbed him anyway. A few days ago, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a lower court\u2019s order that the Trump administration \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Trump initially said he would respect the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. But then today, Trump reversed course, declaring that his administration doesn\u2019t have the power to return Abrego Garcia. Bukele, meeting with Trump in the Oval Office, argued that his government also doesn\u2019t have the power to return Abrego Garcia; given that Bukele has already returned several people to the U.S., it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to whether Bukele is simply lying, or whether Abrego Garcia is already dead. This should scare you, for a number of reasons. First, there\u2019s the obvious: Trump is going around arresting innocent people, and sending them to foreign torture-dungeons, apparently for the rest of their lives.

Others didn\u2019t even have any tattoos, and were arrested for no apparent reason. It\u2019s not clear why the Trump administration is doing this. Perhaps it\u2019s to scare immigrants into leaving the country by making an example of a few. Perhaps it\u2019s to simply assert power, or to test the boundaries of what they can get away with. Maybe they\u2019ve really convinced themselves that all of the people they arrested are gang members. Who knows. But what\u2019s clear is that this is brutal and lawless behavior \u2014 the kind of arbitrary arrest and punishment that\u2019s common in authoritarian regimes. The second thing that should scare you is the lawlessness. The Trump administration insists it didn\u2019t defy the Supreme Court, arguing that simply removing any barriers to Abrego Garcia\u2019s return means that they\u2019re complying with the court order to \u201cfacilitate\u201d that return.

If so, it means that due process and the rule of law in America are effectively dead; the President can simply do anything to anyone, for any reason. A more clearly worded SCOTUS ruling would help clarify whether Trump is, in fact, openly defying the Court. The recent ruling did order the lower court to have \u201cdue regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\u201d But this is starting to feel like a constitutional crisis. The third reason the Abrego Garcia case should worry you is that the Trump administration probably intends to go much further. Kilmar Abrego Garcia isn\u2019t an American citizen, but Trump has stated that he wants to start sending U.S. citizens to El Salvador too.

That is the power of a dictator. A few weeks ago I wrote a post asking when, exactly, we could conclude that America had become a dictatorship: It seems clear that if Trump actually does have the ability to arbitrarily send any American to an overseas prison with zero due process and zero oversight by any court of law, then we do, in fact, live in a dictatorship. It\u2019s notable that immediately after complaining about tariffs, the Declaration of Independence complains about King George sending Americans overseas for \u201cpretend offenses\u201d without jury trial: I guess some things never change. In any case, it requires no great stretch of the imagination to realize that Trump would use this power to go after his domestic critics.

This fits with a general pattern of extreme corruption in the Trump administration, but it\u2019s also an attempt to use presidential power to turn the media into outlets for regime propaganda. How much any of this will affect Trump\u2019s popularity remains to be seen.

But the reason I say this is because what it means for a century to \u201cbelong\u201d to a specific country will change from what it meant in the 20th \u2014 and often in ways that will not be very pleasant. What does it mean for a century to \u201cbelong\u201d to a country? The 20th century often gets called the \u201cAmerican century\u201d, but there\u2019s no one reason why. It\u2019s just sort of a gestalt impression that the U.S. was the most important country during that century. There were lots of dimensions in which this was true: The U.S. had the largest economy in the world, and was the dominant manufacturing nation. The U.S. was militarily dominant, having the world\u2019s most powerful military for almost the entire century.

The U.S. was geopolitically central; it played a key role in creating and sustaining various international institutions, created the world\u2019s largest and most powerful network of alliances, and provided global public goods like freedom of the seas. The U.S. was historically central, playing the most important role in shaping many of the key global events of the 20th century \u2014 the World Wars, decolonization, the Cold War, and globalization. In fact, I would argue that our whole modern notion of assigning centuries to countries was pattered after America\u2019s unusual importance across nearly every single domain in the 20th century. It\u2019s hard to think of other historical examples where one country has had such broad-spectrum dominance. The closest comparison has got to be Britain in the 19th century, which gave birth to the Industrial Revolution and built a globe-spanning empire. But even the UK was never as militarily or culturally dominant as America was in the 20th century.

Anyway, the point here is that there\u2019s no reason that we should believe, a priori, that the 21st century will be dominated by anyone the way America dominated the 20th. The historical norm is multipolarity, with different countries and empires having modest leads in various different dimensions for various periods of time. Now, you can argue that globalization and continuous technological progress are both here to stay, meaning that future centuries are permanently more likely to have one dominant country. I think that\u2019s probably true to some extent. But as I\u2019ll explain, I also think that the nature of both globalization and technological progress are changing, in ways that will bias the 21st century toward multipolarity. And some of these changes will result from the power transition from the U.S. to China. Simply put, 20th century America invented the game that it won, whereas China will use its power to invent (and win) a different sort of game.

One area where China already far surpasses America is in state capacity. This is from a post I wrote back in 2023: In his book China\u2019s Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know (which is excellent and which I heavily recommend), Arthur Kroeber offers a grand unified theory of the country\u2019s economy \u2014 that it\u2019s good at rapidly and effectively mobilizing lots of resources, but bad at using those resources in an optimally efficient way. So in the case of say, building too many apartments, or failed Belt and Road projects, or wasteful corporate subsidies, the lack of efficiency can really bite. But if we\u2019re talking about building the world\u2019s biggest high-speed rail system, or creating a world-beating car industry from scratch, or building massive amounts of green energy, then China\u2019s resource-mobilizing approach can accomplish things on a scale no other country has ever accomplished before\u2026 Remember a few years ago, when a bunch of people were sharing this map of a hypothetical U.S. high speed rail system?\u2026Of course, the map and others like it were pure fantasy; in 15 years, California\u2019s much-ballyhooed high speed rail project has managed to almost",

I\u2019m not exaggerating; you can look these numbers up on Wikipedia. As of last year, China had 42,000 km of high-speed railways in operation, with another 28,000 km planned. That\u2019s compared to just 2,727 km in Japan, with its famous shinkansen. The U.S. used to have much higher state capacity than it does now, back in the middle of the 20th century \u2014 it was able to outproduce all other nations during World War 2, build the interstate highway system, and so on. But modern Chinese state capacity vastly exceeds even America\u2019s peak. What other nation could have maintained the kind of draconian, micro-managed Covid lockdowns that China kept all the way through 2022?

The UN predicts that by 2030, China will represent 45% of all global manufacturing \u2014 higher than the U.S. ever achieved except for a brief moment after World War 2. But also recall that manufacturing is falling as a percent of China\u2019s GDP, as service industries grow. So unless China somehow turns out to be uniquely weak in the service sector, we can probably expect its overall economic dominance to be just as big as America\u2019s was, or bigger. Nor do I think the loss of U.S. export markets will hurt China much. Tyler asks: \u201cWhere will China sell the rising output from their factories?\u201d. The answer to that question is \u201cChina\u201d. Contrary to popular belief, China is not that export-intensive of an economy, compared to the likes of France, Germany, or South Korea: China had a brief period of export-oriented growth in the 2000s, but that\u2019s basically over. Now, China sells most of what it produces to Chinese people. Even the vaunted \u201cSecond China Shock\u201d is mostly an overflow phenomenon; for example, China has become the world\u2019s top car exporter, but the vast majority of the vehicles it makes are for domestic consumption.

Lack of demand from America is highly unlikely to cripple or even substantively reduce China\u2019s economic progress, especially as the Chinese economy shifts to services.

With economic dominance will come military dominance. The smaller nations of the world are probably more able to resist conquest and domination by their larger neighbors now, thanks to nuclear proliferation and the shift of technologies toward tactical defense (basically, drones and missiles blow up vehicles, and guns shoot down drones). But China\u2019s size and manufacturing strength will allow it to overwhelm any nation that resists it, and that threat will be enough to overawe most. But the similarities probably stop there.

In terms of technological leadership, China will certainly shine \u2014 but not in the same way America did. In a post last month, I argued that China overall is a highly innovative country, but that due to weak IP protections and other institutional factors, its innovations tend to be a blizzard of incremental improvements with few dramatic breakthroughs: To American ears, this sounds like a condemnation of China\u2019s system, but to China\u2019s leaders this is probably just fine. If China simply appropriates or copies any new invention and scales it up more efficiently than anyone else can, it still comes out on top. And my sense is that coming out on top is far more important to China\u2019s leadership than furthering the aggregate progress of human knowledge and prosperity. If weak IP protections discourage breakthrough discovery and invention all over the world, so what?

It will still be the technological leader, just not the kind the U.S. was. In the cultural realm, I expect China to be more isolated and less influential than America was. Partly this is because of language \u2014 English is far more internationalized than Chinese will ever be (though AI will erode this barrier significantly). But partly it\u2019s because of social control. China is a deeply repressive nation, with universal surveillance, fine-grained media and speech control, and ubiquitous censorship. That\u2019s the kind of society where only anodyne, cautious artistry can flourish, except in tiny subcultural pockets too small for the government to worry about.

As for geopolitics, I think Tyler is certainly right that China will provide fewer global public goods than America did. It will be less interested in creating freedom of the seas for other nations, and more narrowly concerned with protecting its own trade. Its military will make sure energy supplies reach Chinese shores, but probably won\u2019t be interested in making energy globally abundant. Research is another example; China\u2019s government will make sure China dominates every frontier technology, but won\u2019t care as much about expanding the frontier.
